Full review in Spanish. , The standard in modern blockbuster filmmaking. I don’t make the rules..A meaningful blockbuster that fails to play ignorant to craft or soul, it is no wonder that so many have fallen in love with the world of Pandora and the drama that takes place on it..W atching Avatar s 4K HDR format on IMAX 3D looks more incredible and visually stunning than the original 3D version in 2009.....still a gorgeous sci fi epic, but the characters are nowhere near as detailed..Cameron and his artists have so lovingly imagined the moon of Pandora that every shot of the film contains new wonders..James Cameron’s been conjuring in his fevered imagination for as long as twenty years a true ripper. Of all the things that can and will be said about lt I gt Avatar lt I gt . is that it’s the one 2009 feature drawing from the War in Iraq that could make a mint..The same concepts are repeated over and over, and the sense of wonder gets lost progressively until it reaches a final struggle as spectacular as it is empty. Full review in Spanish.Functioning as both an action packed war movie and an allegory for our own beleaguered planet, Avatar smashes big set pieces together with big emotion to rousing effect..Absolutely astounding fantasy extravaganza. I was entirely immersed and immensely amazed. Avatar is a pure cinematic magic..With ground breaking cinematography and an amazing score delivered by James Horner to match, Avatar promises to set the ball rolling for the way films will look in the next decade.....as a member of the audience, I am happy enough to spend an afternoon communing with a society of blue creatures that look nothing like me..This is the evolution of entertainment.

But hes not the Kubrick he thinks he is, either , A spectacular but irregular closing to the adventures of Christopher Nolan and Christian Bales Batman. Full Review in Spanish , The Dark Knight Rises colors the superhero film as its come to be defined by Marvel in a grimier shade, and features multiple Oscar winners to boot. , A brilliant example, through Batman and a superhero lens, of the power of revolution as a national myth, and how it can come to define a society..It is the perfect film for what it needs to be..The Dark Knight Rises may not always click intellectually, but it delivers some of the most rousing emotional highs of Nolan s career..Here Christopher Nolan brilliantly closes the final chapter of one of the most amazing film trilogies of recent times. Full review in Spanish.A GREAT FINAL for the trilogy. Full Review in Spanish.The Dark Knight Rises delivers a satisfying and emotional conclusion to a trilogy which will go down in history as one of the best ever. This is Christopher Nolans crowning achievement and a perfect Batman film. , ...RISES gives the finish Nolans characters deserve, but to say it reaches the heights of its predecessors is predictably hard. , This conceit feels somewhat stale this time around, but a fearsome turn by Hardy keeps the action taut and the film exciting..A work that tries to honour and conclude the trilogys politicking on its slippery themes of civic responsibility versus the value of self preservation. , The Dark Knight Rises caps off the trilogy with a high but bittersweet note..So rousingly, so emotionally, and so incalculably gratifying."

John Carter is the real deal. , For the most part, the first live action feature by Andrew Stanton, is graphically splendiferous and enjoyably nonsensical..John Carter has a sense of adventure, a sense of fun and, best of all, a sense of proportion. Its a family friendly bet that honors its roots and its audience. , An enjoyable piece of mainstream escapist cinema, its often illogical plot held together by a decent cast, some well placed Flash Gordon esque moments of humor and a strict mandate to never take itself too seriously."

Yay , Its such a soul sucking, humourless mess of technobabble and gobble de gook, Im pretty sure sitting through it made me a Scientologist or something. , John Carter isnt completely bad a lot of individual elements work quite well but its a mess and its so science fictiony as to be alienating. , As negative leaning as most of this article is, John Carter is still fun and offers occasional moments of glory..The movie is still one tacky sight..Even if Edgar Rice Burroughs 11 volume series is adapted by its three screenwriters into a nonsensical mess, then it should at least be a visual feast, right Hardly."

Rapunzel strikes a deal with the charming thief to act as her guide to travel to the place where the floating lights come from that she has seen every year on her birthday. Rapunzel is about to have the most exciting and magnificent journey of her life.",positive,1.0,"At its finest moments, this production emanates the nostalgic feel of classic 2 D animated Disney films..Disney comes closer to nailing the mix of entertainment and emotional resonance that has become a trademark of the Pixar films..What the adaptation by Dan Fogelman offers is an updated rosary of the best that Disney had valued in past times. Full Review in Spanish.The highest compliment I can give the animators is at times I forgot I was watching a computer animated 3D movie..A glorious throwback, a toe tapping, swoon worthy fairy tale extravaganza the likes of which we havent seen in a long time. , Its not classic Disney... but it is still good enough to appease families looking for a night out at the movies. , For me it is a quick top 10 favorite..Tangled is a delightful rendition of a well known fantasy that can be enjoyed by Disney animation and fairytale fans of all ages..A welcome reminder of some of Disneys best works. The animation is exquisite, the script fantastic, and the leads all perform well. , Disney found the right combination of heart, laughs, and fairy dust to make a princess movie with the appeal of its classics and thats also right in 2010. , A heroine who finds love and freedom after she loses acres of blond Barbie hair these days, thats a radical fable. , This snappy role reversal may or may not appeal to young men, but it inspires some classic knockabout screwball comedy and an exciting, vertiginous escape sequence..A tight little package that sings and dances, Tangled is a well conditioned and rather shiny little piece of entertainment..This is your basic, and very enjoyable, Disney princess musical, an empowerment tale to teach bright, dreamy girls how to grow to maturity and outgrow the adults in charge..If this is what old fashioned means, then bring it on..While it lasts, the magic works..Tangled isnt perfect but having grown up with Disney cartoons, theres something quite heartwarming about seeing the studio approach past brilliance in the face of intense competition from Pixar and DreamWorks. , Disney has a good hair day as the revamped story of Rapunzel leaps from the screen, and not just because its made in 3 D. , Basically, its the old Disney formula done with a lot more elan."

Review in Spanish.Its competently executive as a movie, but as an adaptation... its badly done. , The most mature Potter film yet, dealing with emotional issues much stronger than any previous installment, and the young cast more than steps up to the plate..While the sixth chapter in the popular series from writer J.K. Rowling has some similar problems to its predecessor, it manages to inject some much needed magic and charm back into the franchise..With real chemistry between the characters, laugh out loud scenes of teen wizard angst, and some truly spectacular cinematography, it may even be the best in the series..... reaffirms the hypothesis that the sixth Harry Potter movie only constitutes of a transitional film, between the little wizards and the senior wizards that will face Voldemort in Potter s last magical battle. Full review in Spanish.What I liked about this one is the mystery, which is always at the heart of a Harry Potter story..Any movie that works as a spy thriller, love story, and horror movie all at once is pretty remarkable. You might say it takes a fair amount of wizardry..Mostly I love Harry Potter for the actors.I thought Rupert Grint came out of this the best of all of them..Half Blood is a sustaining visit with beloved old if not in age friends..The movie can never shake the feeling that its one big set up, a meek prelude to the thrill ride to come in Deathly Hallows. , Not only is Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince an excellent translation of J.K. Rowlings addictive canon, but its also the first entry to shine on its own devoid of its backdrop mythology. , Seamlessly and vigorously conveyed, this satisfying segment raises the storytelling and visual effects bar for the entire series."

Can anyone drawn to Bond live to tell the tale?",positive,1.0,"Quantum of Solace might not reach the same highs as Casino Royale, but in the context of the entire James Bond franchise, it is hard to say that the film is not one of the better editions simply considering it is overall competent..Quantum of Solace has style, and enough pursuit and pyrotechnics to please hard core Bond fans. But it may disappoint those hoping for Marc Forsters distinctive imprint and a return to Casino Royales top form. , Bond is being further shaped into the character weve always known, and will most definitely be back to fight another day. , Unfairly maligned in relation to its more colourful and emotive cousins of the Daniel Craig era, Quantum of Solace is actually the more cerebral and challenging piece of work..This isnt a mindless blow em up thriller, this is an intelligently crafted, superbly edited, lean, mean piece of work. , While its understandable that long term Bond devotees may be left pining for the days when the puns were a bit more plentiful, and the punches a bit less lethal, I for one hope they dont go too far back in the other direction. , The angsty, truant Bond and his sulky ways get too irritating, the pout notwithstanding."

Nonsense. , Starts off alright but slowly becomes less and less interesting until it suddenly ends, plus the villain is more mildly annoying prick than Bond s big enemy....Its not the first Bond film to fall back into a rut that will require the changing of the lead actor to get out of. , I dont mind losing the groan inducing puns and the gimmicky gadgets, but strip Bond down too much and he begins to resemble Jason Bourne and Id rather have a first rate Bond than a second hand Bourne. , Quantum of Solace is how I imagined the sequel to On Her Majestys Secret Service if it came to fruition. , Quantum of Solace is one of the most listless Bond films I have seen..A plot of an unnecessarily complex development that fails miserably in something that its predecessor did very well offer characters that seduce us. Full Review in Spanish.Perhaps confusing the audience is what Forster meant when he said he was making an art house picture..At the end of Solace there are a couple of unhappy but typical realizations 1 that the film only runs 106 minutes when it seemed more like 166, and 2 that its still hard to say whether Daniel Craig moves well as an action hero. , Somehow Marc Forsters direction sucks all the vitality out of the film. Theres no thrill in the chase. With the exception of an absolutely first rate fight sequence on scaffolding in a church under renovation, Bond is having no fun at all. , Kurylenko is certainly gorgeous, but cant match Craig as a thespian, and the necessary chemistry between them is merely mundane."

If you choose to hop aboard, I guarantee youll be in for quite the ride. , Its hard to believe that as each year goes by, despite the substantial advances in computer graphics and filmmaking techniques, movies continue to become more unrealistic. , A barely coherent story lightly disguised by big explosions and CGI..The philosophy behind the movie, which stretches to two and a half hours, seems to be the same one that inspired the all you can eat Vegas buffet..An altogether enjoyable summer entertainment that manages, in its own way, to hearken back to those thrilling days of yesteryear..In spite of the length, its still an enjoyable watch filled with more laughs than expected, or is probably appropriate for the genre. , It certainly isnt perfect, but give The Lone Ranger a chance if youre in the mood for some old fashioned western adventure fun. , The Lone Ranger is a film that manages to be bad in many ordinary ways and, also, to be bad in a rather extraordinary way..The Lone Ranger wasnt the best film Ive seen this summer, but it is far from the worst.

Why bother.Hi Yo, Silver, Away And sadly, thats what you may be doing going away... , Good news, Washington Redskins For one glorious weekend in the summer of 2013, your unapologetically racist franchise is not the most grotesque pop culture representation of Native Americans.Often patently ridiculous, with plenty of outrageous stunts and off the wall humor, but thats part of its singular charm. , Its just dreadful and a failed attempt at a franchise that needs to ride off into the sunset and be forgotten forever. , The overlong plot lacks smarts the action a train wreck aside lacks thrills and the cascade of characters including turns from Helena Bonham Carter and Tom Wilkinson lack the necessary depth or spark..The Lone Ranger has its good moments, but it has many more that just dont come together into a cohesive whole. , This movie is almost condescending in its lack of concern for logic, continuity and charm."

Full review in Spanish.A flawed but still solid Spider Man movie which delivers plenty of spectacular moments to keep comic book fans happy. However, a few too many unanswered questions stop it from living up to that Amazing title..The Amazing Spider Man is enjoyable filled with great moments and wonderful performances from Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone..The Amazing Spider Man is truly amazing..The Amazing Spider Man, despite telling the same story again is not only successful, but a lot of fun to watch..A film that works best on an intimate scale, although Webb proves quite adept at directing compelling action sequences..Garfield is probably too old for the part, the same can be said for Stone, but he brings a new spin and some great energy in the lead role."

Full review in Spanish.Enchanting in its own way, The Golden Compass is a cold, dark fable..Director Chris Weitz... manages to bring out the best in his ensemble cast and never fails to lose the attention of the viewer throughout 114 minutes..An engaging fantasy adventure that, albeit no masterpiece, is hardly the disaster one might have imagined..This plot may sound somewhat ludicrous on paper, but Pullman has created a logical, well thought out world that Weitz has brilliantly translated to the big screen.....if I hadnt liked Pullmans books so much, I probably would have liked this movie version more than I did. , Will it be enough to satisfy fans of Philip Pullmans widely read His Dark Materials trilogy Hard to say. But for the uninitiated this is an engaging adventure, even when Chris Weitzs screenplay lacks the compelling clarity of Pullmans prose."

As experience, it will strike those who let it as profound..Cameron has filled this saga almost to the bursting point with stories and themes that stretch from romance to expose, from parables of hubris to celebrations of industry. This is a great, sprawling film because it urgently needs to be so..Titanic was expected to be impressive. It is, friends, much more than that. It attains a state of humbling majesty, evoking with a sense of unashamed grandeur a terribly out of style but vital emotion, awe..The young lovers, portrayed by the talented Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, are beautiful and blessed in finding each other, and their story, as told by the old woman, humanizes an event daunting in its scope and impact..The movie, however, is a triumph of truly titantic proportions. Proof that directors and actors can work alongside computer generated effects without being swamped by the technology..James Camerons deeply disappointing Titanic is a sad thing when set against the modest, factual 1958 film, A Night to Remember. , The marriage of simplistic plots and stylistic excesses is a hallmark of James Cameron’s movies, and this is his masterwork, for good and ill..Winslet is breathtakingly vivid in her emotional transparency. She easily masters the American accent as well as a young upper class girls petulant pride. , There are moments of suspense which will have even the blase digging their nails into the armrest.

In the midst of all of the hydraulic set spasms, dauntless stuntwork and computerized mirages, Titanic cultivates one of the best mainstream love stories Hollywood has produced in years. , Visually, the movie is undeniably impressive theres no question where all the money went.

Its that its not a Pixar film. , Start your engines Youre in for the adventure of your life with Cars 2. , Yes, the movie has some weak spots. A little long, a little light on story, and, gratefully, heavy on visuals...but I say, with Pixar, do we always need missing parents and tearjerking, with tissues always an arms reach away , I defy anyone to tell me with a straight face that this is anywhere near as awful as 2011s other family hits, Zookeeper and Mr. Poppers Penguins. Case closed. , The trouble with stuffing too much into a film quickly becomes evident in Cars 2, as the plotlines tumble and collide with each other creating, mostly, cacophony..Theres a fine line between being healthily assertive in joining the conversation and being rude, however unintentionally. Mater is on the wrong side of that line, which gives Cars 2 a bit of a strange message. , Theres much to look at, but little to follow. , Cars 2 suffers from a charmless and immoderately talky storyline that hikes up the thrills but forgets the widespread appeal of its far superior contemporaries..If youre interested in seeing wonderful landscapes created by the magic of digital animation and some of the most colorful characters never created in the automotive industry world, this is just the movie for you... Full review in Spanish , The problems start and end with the uninspired, witless and convoluted script..To its credit, Cars 2, despite its over busy plot and constant action, certainly isnt, well, on automatic.

Full Review in Spanish.Green Lanterns light faded for me, and was out completely by the time the final credits rolled. , Green Lantern is as cheesy and has more plot holes and dangling story strings than a piece of 70s macrame. , The film never rises above a screenplay that seems to be pulling in several directions, leaving the material battling with tone and consistency. The result is a lifeless attempt at a blockbuster that never quite gets out of the block..All the prancing about on a galaxy far far away where Hal Ryan Reynolds meets the other Green Lanterns, and the wise ancients, and a gigantic gruff sergeant type who learns him his ropes is all a bit of a bore..There are some fun moments in Green Lantern, and Reynolds and Sarsgaard...are truly worth watching. The movie, however, flickers between being fun and a mess..While hes not a compelling enough character or superhero to care about, as Green Lantern, Ryan Reynolds is believable in his solemnity, yet his comedic charm helps when dealing with the absurdity that comes with the premise. , With a cast like that, this superhero flick, like Hal Jordan himself, had real potential to rise above its provenance. But the dialogue is simply beyond cheesy."

There is something for everyone in the film, which is easily the best major American studio release Ive seen in 2010. , Toy Story 3 has magic in spades..Dear Pixar, THANK YOU for not churning out yet another inferior straight to DVD animated sequel, and instead taking the time to create something that will be as dear to Toy Story fans at the first time we saw Woody amp Buzz on screen..From moments of pure delight to one of the most heartbreaking goodbyes in recent movie memory, the trilogy wraps up in a masterful way and once again proves Pixar is on a level all its own..With a heart felt ending and truly outstanding story, Toy Story 3 has ensured that the franchise and all the characters we have known and loved, will be remembered for infinity, and beyond..Whats so distressing about all this, as I keep pointing out, is the tremendous talent of the Pixar team getting wasted on nostalgic goop, forever presenting idealized 1950s suburban culture as the norm. , Moments of uproarious humor and emotional farewells offset the darkness and send Woody and his pals on a memorable ride off into the sunset..Like last years Up from the same company, Pixar, this film tickles the funny bone but also brings a tear to the eye. , Hilarity, terrors, the melancholy of love and loss and growing up, and millions of adult baby tears ensue."

The movie sounds like jets crashing into a junkyard, one after another....I think McG just wants to show he can spend more money blowing up more stuff more better than Michael Bay. And thats just McDumb. , Terminator Salvation could almost pass as a sequel to Mad Max, which goes to show just how everyone involved is merely going through the motions..This is big empty turgid gunk, coming more from the brainless Transformers school than the Cameron Big Art Pop philoso candy cloth..Everything that made the Terminator films great is absent in this film. The violence, the terror, the basic fear is gone ... In this film, children defeat a terminator..Once the screeching din has died down, you wont recall a single line of dialogue, note of music or plot point that wasnt punctuated with an explosion. , This franchise, like its villains, has become more machine than man..That the films overall basic point has already been conveyed by the closing lines of T2 some 18 years ago shows just how completely superfluous this cash grab is."

We also didn t need to land on the moon. Nor did we need to create the 1967 Ford Mustang. We did it because it was awesome and we could, dammit..We want these films to go on forever, and perhaps they will but, for now, this is a fine film to ride off into the sunset to..If this is the end of an era, its ended on a high note."

To those who loudly pshawed at lead fridges and aliens, I pshaw right back. , With an unfettered, throw caution to the wind, giddy joy and death defying exhilaration and even alien mysticism, Spielberg and partner George Lucas, bring the magic of the 30s and 40s popcorn serial larger than life E ticket ride, back to the movies. , An entertaining throwback that feels as comfortable as an old varsity letter jacket. Sure, the material is familiar, but this is a case where that familiarity is part of the charm..Despite its shortcomings, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an absolute blast..Its adequate, but not exceptional, and while that might be enough for any other movie, this is an Indiana Jones movie, and that cant help but be a little disappointing. , Crystal Skull carries its legacy with a sort of I still got it bravado that makes you smile at its AARP filmmakers rather than pity them..While theres no denying that Crystal Skull succeeds as a summer popcorn flick, it wont follow in Raiders footsteps by becoming a classic audiences will want to watch again and again for years to come. , Except for one grossly offensive aspect done twice Crystal Skull is everything Indy fans want. Its a big, noisy, entertaining escape from reality. It makes no sense whatsoever and who cares , Everything happens so dizzyingly fast and with such a dazzling disregard for any kind of realism it sort of doesnt matter that the plot is a silly rambling nonsense or that Harrison Ford is now 312. , Good special effects, an entertaining story and nostalgia... Full review in Spanish.Accusing Steven Spielberg of overkill at this point in his career, however, seems redundant. Indy IV is an entertaining big screen ride for the whole family, excluding small children and fussy cinephiles."

In Pixars world dinosaurs can cry... and just might make you shed a tear as well. , We used to say Pixar could do no wrong, but they did and they did a terrible wrong, something not even worthy of the Disney animation division in their worst ruts..Of all of Disney Pixars work, this is by far the most absurd. , Filled with a visual and emotional magic and majesty that touches the senses and the heart, The Good Dinosaur is Dino Rrific , What rises the entertainment quality of The Good Dinosaur above what is unquestionably derivative are those encounters, and the environments in which they experience them..A visually gorgeous, minimalist survival Western filled with weirdos, danger, and surprisingly mature themes..For me, The Good Dinosaur will be a pleasant, forgettable experience. But for some kid out there, its going to be the first time they grappled with the concept of mortality. In that sense, the movie may not be that good, but at least its doing good. , It works fine on its own and is an entertaining and occasionally moving childrens film, it just feels a bit more anonymous than the high quality weve come to expect from Pixar. , Innovation and imagination prove to be as extinct as pterodactyls in the modern world..This is a film like Bambi or Dumbo that are about the growth of a character and are artistically ambitious at the same time..Its impossible to rave enough about the elemental beauty of The Good Dinosaur. , The Good Dinosaur is more humble than Pixars typical fare, choosing to refine and riff on familiar ideas and themes rather than build new ones from the ground up and live on the cutting edge. , Its dark, depressing and pretty questionable as a family film. , A film that works in the moment, but doesnt really have any long term staying power. , It has a few flashes of fun, as with a Triceratops...and some moments of real beauty, one of which is prominently featured in the advertising. Still, its not the kind of surprising, imaginative fare we normally associate with Pixar. , A unique film with a simple story that I feel will be enjoyed by most, but not loved and remembered over time like other PIXAR films."

But it is that gentleness and wonderfully specific earnestness that distinguish it for the better..In the end, Brave really does mark a return to quality for Pixar..Youre not going to see a more beautiful, eye appealing movie than Brave this year. , I was pulled in by the film with fair ease, but eventually it seemed unsure where to go, and ultimately I dont think it really ever found a path of its own , Brave, the new film from Pixar, is the most beautiful movie Ive seen in years. , Effectively creates its own world and mythology it would be easy to think it is an old tale updated by the story shamans at Pixar, but its a new story that feels timeless. , A grandly mediocre accomplishment..Be transported to ancient Scotland and a land of magic and adventure. The most visually stunning animated film of the year, Brave hits the bullseye Move over Katniss Meridas in town , ...call me picky, but it seems a shame that a movie devoted to demolishing an outdated stereotype of female subservience enlists legion hall of hoary stereotypes to do so..Theres plenty of rowdy humor to keep audiences entertained. But for a supposedly progressive film, Brave is marked by a notable amount of timidity. , Merida is an appealing heroine, and the colorful cast of characters is great fun, voiced by a lineup of outstanding talent such as Billy Connolly, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters and Craig Ferguson..I enjoy watching it but it could have been a real masterpiece..The mother daughter relationship is the films strength, with some heartfelt exchanges that feel as authentic as most live action films. , This latest outing just goes to show that even an off day at Pixar HQ can result in a well told tale more than worthy of your time and attention."

Full review in Spanish , Hugo may be the film closest to the heart of Scorsese, a dedicated cinephile and film preservationist..Hugo has plenty to indulge a silent film aficionado or to educate a young film buff..Exquisitely acted and a heretofore unequalled artistic use of 3D..Two hours of remarkable cinema that is, dare I say it, truly magical. Somehow, I think Melies would have been proud..Ive not been a fan of 3 D films in general, but Hugo takes full advantage of the technology, creating a storybook like world with rich layers and textures. That alone is enough to make Hugo worth seeing, but the film is much more. , Hugo is reverent, but also joyful we come away from the film feeling like were lucky to have all this in our history. , It cant be counted a modern classic like so many of Scorseses other films. But its a charming flight of fancy, if not for children, then for their parents who are still young at heart. , Martin Scorseses family fantasy blend s a beautifully imagined treasure hunt with a tribute to cinemas early pioneers. , Whether young or old, Hugo remains an arresting, heartwarming delight and one of the must see films of the festive period."

Blunt and Cruise invest a great deal of heart in their action heroics, thankfully minimising the hokum romance angle. , The strength of the lead performances and the inventive use of sci fi conventions make this better than the usual mainstream fare..Edge of Tomorrow represents another consistent film from director Doug Liman. From projects such as The Bourne Identity, The O.C. to Mr and Mrs Smith, this film is by far his best work..This is exactly the raucous, smart adventure that you want out of a big summer blockbuster release..Edge of Tomorrow is a fun, rip roaring sci fi actioner ... It has explosions and gunfire and aliens, yet it s also very smart with a wicked sense of humor."

And under the direction of Jon Favreau, who also has a minor role as Starks thuggish driver, Happy Hogan, the script is loaded with witty dialogue. But the action is as dumb as the dialogue is smart. , A big time superhero spectacle that delivers to both fans and newcomers alike..Its a little messy and not nearly up to par with the original, but this is still an acceptable sequel with just enough fun to appease its fan base. , Iron Man 2 would be surpassed by some other offerings in the MCU, notably the first two Captain America movies, but it remains one of the smartest and least silly chapters in the 22 film extravaganza..Iron Man 2 is still a good film but Im saddened to report that it is not the rare sequel that becomes greater than its predecessor. , Iron Man 2 doesnt take itself seriously its a nonstop joyride starring a wisecracked eccentric atypical superhero, and it deftly delivers. , While I didnt hate it, Iron Man 2 just isnt as memorable and as begging of a rewatch as many other Marvel movies."

Yet the central performances shine through and there is just enough humour..The writing of this psychological morality tale is superb..This is what happens when faerie tales are taken for the explorations of the human game that they truly are..Snow White and the Huntsman takes the ageless fable, and makes it dark and exhausting..Rupert Sanders vision of enchantment is a Thomas Kinkade painting brought to life. , For all its flaws and there are more of them than in Charlize Evil Queen Theron s magically aged face Snow White delivers exactly what you expect from a fairy tale.

Its masked in allegory but it doesnt shy away from big ideas and thats the thing that transforms it from a run of the mill air conditioner flick to a thought provoking night and exciting at the movies. , Though it may be a single component to a larger picture, which will likely see director Matt Reeves return to finish off the tale, its wholly enjoyable all by itself. , Serkis, and maybe even Kebbell, deserve awards attention here for their nothing short of inspiring performances..Andy Serkis has become the Roddy McDowall of Planet of the Apes franchise, delivering the emotion and heart that makes Caesar come to life just like his predecessor did as Cornelius..Epic and bold, it, in true Apes fashion, aims to examine the animal in man by looking at the more human side of the animals..Dawn of the Planet of the Apes carries on the strong story begun in Rise and improves on it..More than it being boring, more than it being sort of oatmeal y, the biggest problem with this movie is the score. Its really distracting. , It was competently made... for the most part..The result is a powerful, well structured yet slightly biased sequel that further justifies the Planet of the Apes reboot or at least the origins of the franchise..There are enough impressive elements to power through its basic tendencies, due mostly to the riveting special effects and primate storylines, and yet another aggressively engaging presence from Andy Serkis..The most important thing is this although these Apes have ditched some of the trippier elements, they have retained the social awareness and have infused summer spectacle with humanistic moralizing..Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the tonic that proves brilliant, deep films can be made by a Hollywood major..In a world where simple black and white morality is popular, there are few Hollywood films, especially with this large a budget, that could ever tackle such complex thematic material..The special effects... still felt really real and lush and natural..The first half is dull and predictable, but Dawn just about earns its stars with a flurry of shocks and showdowns in the second half..Though it juggles multiple characters struggling with inner conflicts inside of a larger external conflict, the film never feels unstable, confusing, or lopsided."

Full review in Spanish.A terrible sequel that does nothing to gain its value. Full review in Spanish ..The fun seems gone, and the now requisite end credits musical number seems like a relic from 2001..The attack on the formulaic construction of Disneys fairy tales seems hypocritical as this film uses the same tired formula used throughout the franchise only this time, it is weaker than ever. , Other than the fact that its animated and some of the characters are vaguely based on fairytale characters, nothing about Shrek Forever After caters to kids. , The rot set in with the third film, I think, and now, with the fourth, its decomposed and gone to that black sludge you get at the bottom of the bin. , If this is to be Shreks last outing, its good to see him bow out in style. , Shrek Forever After is a very mediocre affair, with crummy 3D and a real lack of laughs..Shrek Forever After feels more like a direct to video release than one that should have been put in theaters..Shrek Forever After is the latest in a long, mediocre tradition. What charms it does have cant really compete with the charms it doesnt have. , DreamWorks and the unlovable ogre lose the plot..Shreks inspired mash up of the world of fairy tales and contemporary pop culture is now yielding diminishing returns. , Reveals an urge by the filmmakers to wipe the slate clean, as large an admission that the series is out of ideas as one could get. That said, all involved do try to make the most of it."

The same will never be said of Nolan..Inception is an intriguing, frustrating film, but ultimately satisfying..Mind blowing doesnt even begin to describe director Christopher Nolans latest foray into the mystifying realm of the subconscious. , Joseph Gordon Levitt gives the films workhorse performance with tremendous heart and muscle. , A multilayered, self reflexive action film that fires on all cylinders, manipulating time through meticulous editing to deliver a hard hitting cinematic experience..One of the best movies of 2010..Inception is a different kind of heist film but it is hard to imagine it coming from any filmmaker other than Christopher Nolan..Ten years later, Inception continues to function as a thrilling sci fi heist film, but its deeper secrets are what has cemented it as Christopher Nolans masterpiece. , Overall, the film is one of a kind, a masterpiece and a work of art so to speak. The superior musical score that accompanies the film heightens the suspense and adds to the mystery sequences..Nolan masterfully weaves all these elements together, creating a second act that is breathtaking, suspenseful and thought provoking...unfortunately, it takes us a good hour for us to get there..Lose yourself in Chris Nolans dream world. You may never want to wake up. , A smart summer thriller filled with visionary set pieces, grand imagery and exciting twists, but its lack of an emotional center keeps it just short of greatness..A mind bending thriller that is a complete original, cementing Nolans status as one of this generations brightest filmmakers."

This, though, has very little of any of the above, and it breaks my heart..With a plot lacking no urgency, Shrek 3 is a well animated film containing a few standout, but ultimately throwaway sequences that dont do enough to sustain our interest. , Computer animated ugliness.From its humble, elegant origins as a slim childrens book by William Steig, Shrek has metastasized into a symptom of and metaphor for the entertainment industry and modern culture in general. , Shrek the Third has the curse of the third in a bankable series. It is too often sappy, tiresome, and overblown. A franchise such as Shrek, with all the money it has accumulated, should be able to buy a little freshness and originality. But instead.Apart from some modestly amusing princess shtick and a pleasantly slapsticky opening, theres no real reason for anyone over the age of 11 to see this one. , The best thing it has going for it is its look, which is stunning..Though the devious wit of the original remains, it is obscured by too many classic rock interludes courtesy of Led Zeppelin, Heart and Paul McCartney and nudging pop culture references that seem by now just part of the formula..The problem with this film is that after a quick, fun beginning they repeat a similar journey from the first film. Except this time, Shrek and Artie argue instead of Shrek and Fiona..Your kids may enjoy it, but you would do better to wait for the video..While there are times of moderate amusement, Shrek the Third offers few surprises. It seems as though perhaps the creators have found their stride and are calling it in more than going out on a limb."

Review in Spanish.For the first time, the stakes of this battle of good and evil become painfully evident..It feels rushed and there are definitely the most plotholes in this entry in the series. Still, when it does work it really works..Goblet of Fire is great, very watchable and re watchable..Where Newell really scores is in taking a leaf out of Peter Jacksons book and cranking up the fear factor. , For those like me who are outside but sympathetic to the faith, it looks like another handsomely made, good natured and high spirited family movie, which is dramatically stymied through being locked within school grounds..For the first time, adults might actually enjoy a Harry Potter film as much as children..The adolescent subplot is treated sweetly by Newell. The awkward dances and dating faux pas at the school ball feel like additions from some other, less mythic series, and form a welcome respite from the intense magic making of the rest of the film..Much of the credit goes to Radcliffe and his co stars, who have become better actors with each film. They have become increasingly adept at conveying great emotion as each film demands more of them..I think this is the best Potter film yet, for one simple reason its not like a Harry Potter film. , In its last third, The Goblet of Fire builds to a climax of such overpowering dread that you might just forget the rest. Harry grows up in an instant, and the film does, too..The acting is stronger than ever in this fourth installment..By demonstrating to us how Harry and his friends are budding and changing and struggling, the film demonstrates the progressive richness of Rowlings storytelling skills and oddly haunting allure of her writing. , All in all, Goblet of Fire is certainly the best Potter yet, with most of the cast doing their roles justice, some great direction and Steven Kloves screenplay makes the core of Rowlings novel into a fast paced but easily comprehensible enjoyable movie. , Kloves has streamlined J. K. Rowlings 700 plus page opus into cinematic fighting form. And the special effects, which threatened to overwhelm the first two movies, are seamlessly integrated. , Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is mostly satisfying, simply because such technical precision and meaningful special effects are rare in fantasy films today."

But as much as I might try to simulate their point of view, I can only see it through my own battered eyeballs, which feel like theyve aged 10 years in the 90 minutes spent watching it. , If you dont enjoy this you probably dont like Christmas , Its one of Dreamworks best animated films for sure. , This erratic flurry of light and colour is made more than bearable thanks to a script full of real warmth and a collection of incredibly well drawn characters who truly capture the magic of childhood wonder..Rise of the Guardians is blithe and lovely, smart and funny. Its an honest to goodness family film that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults. , While Rise isnt destined to be a new holiday classic...its a mostly well crafted film with an excellent cast and a dizzying array of visual treats. , Rise of the Guardians has some great concepts, but ultimately needed a much more original story to make it seem more like the fresh idea it genuinely is..While the heroes of DreamWorks film claim to be the guardians of childhood, their tattooed, hoodied posturing actually diminishes it. , Some of the best animation Ive seen in quite some time. , Charming, sweet and enchanting, but not without its flaws, Rise of the Guardians is the hopeful, feel good movie for kids thats fitting for holiday movie watching with the family. , Rise of the Guardians acknowledges the courage of children and teaches the audience to see the signs and symbols of life more deeply and to listen to good inspiration..DreamWorks newest picture is definitely one for the kids, but director Peter Ramsey makes it fun enough to put a smile on parents faces."

Everything else is more or less perfunctory to that..Consider it a signed confession of remake rape when a produced by Jim Carrey credit appears atop his noodle limbed exaggeration of I Believe I Can Fly. his corporate greed satire doesn t just lack bite. It lacks gnaw. It even lacks nibble..The downward mobility of the middle class straight to the poverty level, or crime often not as evil, but rather economic desperation, are plot points hardly likely to sit well with those who control this economy and profit from it..In a strange way, its fitting that a movie about people out of work should itself barely work. , This cynical look at how the American family can only achieve their dreams through crime is a bit more of a political statement rather than comedic entertainment..Carrey and Leoni dont achieve much chemistry, mostly because shes so busy playing straight man to his antics."

The animation is meticulously detailed... , I say scuttle, trot, or gallop down to your very nearest multiplex and joyfully hand over your hard earned cash, potentially more than once, to see this peculiar paragon, this fantastic flying freak flag of a movie..With a perfect cast, some very funny and memorable moments and a beautifully designed look, this is a film that rivals anything from Pixar or the first two Shrek films..Rango is a superbly written, masterfully shot feat of making us believe that yes, ugly critters can also possess the kind of heroic qualities that this world needs more of..Rango is quite beautiful in its harsh, perverse way..Rango is a new stoner cult classic in the making..The weirdness of the film is fascinating, but theres just so damn much of it. , Delivers the western genre goods along with generous laughs and some impressive animation and some brazenly warped sensibilities..Meditations on identity make Rango unique, and somewhat special, in the current animated film landscape..Packed with in jokes, great characters and an offbeat anti hero, Rango is the perfect shake up the animated genre needed."

Full Review in Spanish , Its not a bad movie. I just didnt love it like I was hoping too. , Good performances, excellent special effects, impeccable animation... Full review in Spanish.Well, for a kiddie animation spectacle Id give it more than a passing grade. , Kung Fu Panda is pretty much like it sounds..Kung Fu Panda is not as much fun as Kung Fu Hustle, but its much better than Kung Pow Enter the Fist. , Theres something about the look of Kung Fu Panda that is so novel and pleasing. Perhaps its just that we havent seen this vintage, Far East world in a computer animated movie before. , Some of it just seems silly, which is fine for a family movie, of course, but theres silly and then theres silly. Kung Fu Panda is silly. , When the kids are happy and I get to watch a Jack Black kung fu movie, thats good enough for me. , The animation work is dazzling its lovingly detailed without being overdone particularly the opening sequence, which is hand drawn and looks like prints struck from ancient woodblocks . , Supporting characters including Jolie, who is wasted as a tiger are pallid, and the fight scenes disproportionately long, as if the filmmakers figure the young boys most likely to see Panda are just as action happy as their dads..Kung Fu Panda is hugely entertaining, gorgeously animated and expertly cast, with Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman doing some of their best work in recent memory no joke ..This beautifully designed, cherry blossom hued cartoon is brighter, breezier and bouncier than most..An energetic and surprisingly colorful family adventure tale that trumps formula through sheer force of personality."

Full Review in Spanish , I thought this movie was highly enjoyable on a smaller scale than other Marvel movies..Ant Man remains at the tail of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for not having managed to lower the exacerbated level of comedy on time.

Dingy colour, a pretty rotten script and the two hour length were my main complaints. But it was fun while three quarters of it lasted..Ray Harryhausens stop motion special effects are as wonderfully wobblesome as ever and he comes up with some memorable monsters, notably the petrifying Gorgon Medusa. , Apart from some fine slimy creeps in the Medusa episode, its bland and toothy, with a narrative that gets bogged down in short term action. , There are multiple instances of enjoyment and craftsmanship....Teenage boys will love it, but the rest of us will be frustrated by the storytelling, the shaky camerawork and the dubiously effective 3D presentation, which distracts more than it offers.Mostly the problem is Beverley Cross screenplay, which is unacceptably, irredeemably bad. , Clash of the Titans is an unbearable bore that will probably put to sleep the few adults stuck taking the kids to it."

I m not sure it can..The Bourne Legacy is proof that if they dont bring Matt Damon back, this franchise is going nowhere. Full review in Spanish , Overall, The Bourne Legacy is mostly disappointing, poorly edited and it seems have buckled underneath with the expectations from the original films, which weighed heavily on its shoulders..All we get is two hours of talk, interrupted by the occasional violence and a painfully truncated ending that leaves the door open for The Bourne Whatever They Name The Fifth Part..It just isnt gripping and the story mechanics dont hold up to close scrutiny. , While it may not be satisfactory, both protagonists seem to be in a good place at least for now..The film may get a little cloak and dagger extreme at points, but you know what, who cares.Bourne Legacy is an object lesson in how to screw up a reboot."

Instead it’s a repetitive and sometimes laborious exercise....It just doesnt work taking these short Seuss stories and turning them into a feature film. Very unpleasant to watchd , I truly believe that Dr. Seuss defies adaptation and is best left in print and in the imaginations of all who read the stories..Its just an ugly piece of work. , Director Ron Howard aims for the beautifully stylized mayhem of Frank Tashlin and Tim Burton, but he comes closer to the clamorous, headache inducing visual overkill of Joel Schumachers Batman movies. , Its sweet enough for the very young, edgy enough for teens, and world pop culture savvy enough for adults. , The film is an act of love that doesnt quite transmit all of the passion it wishes it could. Full Review in Spanish , A forgettable film in Ron Howards repertoire. Full Review in Spanish , I just cant imagine the editor and director sitting down together, and THIS being the final product. , They really didnt have solid direction, they were just doing too much. Thats coming from me, someone who routinely does too much. , Director Ron Howard usually lets his comedies gestate organically, but his Grinch is frantic from start to finish..A fundamentally soulless, mercenary attack on soulless, mercenary things, and this ends up being deeply tedious and tiresome to watch, on pretty much every possible level..The director, Ron Howard, is a grand old heartwarmer Cocoon, etc. but the heart of this picture is dead..An unforgivable transgression from the usually reliable Ron Howard, Grinch boasts the visual polish of a Menards tree aisle and resembles not a cheerful Christmas, but rather what the bloodcurdling onset of a mescaline bender might feel like..Five year olds might go for it, but people who grew up with Jones version will be looking at their watches and grinding their teeth."

I was blown away..ees directorial instincts are sharp as ever. He can cultivate a believable relationship between Pi and Richard, relying primarily on subtle body language and, of course, the masterful visual effects. , In my view, people who find no drama in everyday life and lives, and feel obliged, for example, to ski down Mount Everest to keep themselves occupied and excited, are not to be trusted about important matters..Suraj Sharma gives a performance that exudes both boyish charm and a soulful desperation..Giving Ang Lee access to 3D camera equipment and a modern day fable like Life of Pi is the best idea anyone has had in a long time..I have certainly seen dramas about survivors but none, absolutely none that I have seen compare to the spectacular Life of Pi. Full review in Spanish.Among its many virtues, this beautiful fable of a teen boy holding a grown tiger at bay for 277 days at sea makes a strong case for the superiority of live action drama over animation.......in the end, we must abandon ourselves to the storytelling. With a gorgeous film like Life of Pi, thats not hard to do. , Although certain narrative themes seem overblown or loaded with fallacious simplicity, film is a visual medium at heart and LIFE OF PI is the work of a visual storyteller at the top of his game..In a rare alignment of artistic vision and blockbuster ambition, Life of Pi stretches the horizon of cinemas new technology to restore old fashioned movie magic. , Lee imbues the film with remarkable grace, even when its imagery threatens to overwhelm it..This is a strong piece of filmmaking from Lee, an exquisite bit of eye candy that examines the power of God and religion in a sharp and confident manner..A boy, and a tiger, and a vast, endless ocean. Ang Lee makes a film out of material that seems almost unfilmable, and a lot of it is quite wondrous..Ultimately, Life of Pi as film is a visual complement to Yann Martels story as opposed to a fresh telling of its own , Life of Pi is beautifully rendered with some fine performances. Unfortunately, this novel deemed by many to be unfilmable ultimately proves to at least partially earn that distinction. , Lee has successfully married some of this years most sumptuous visuals with one of its most compelling and unashamedly spiritual stories. , The visuals and special effects are imaginatively exquisite..Any old actor will tell you to never share the stage with children or animals. Certainly, that is the case here, as the film is almost exclusively child and animal and wonderful."

OmniCorp envisions a RoboCop in every city and even more billions for their shareholders, but they never counted on one thing: there is still a man inside the machine pursuing justice.",negative,0.0,"Ends up being a far too timid remake..The comparisons are inevitable but the remake is no masterpiece..This new version of RoboCop is an entirely different animal, and thats just fine. Gone is the biting social satire...The social conscience is still there, but its more subtle and more along the lines of commentary than all out satire. , RoboCop wants to be about big ideas like identity, the nature of self, man vss technology, security versus freedom, corporate greed that puts profits over people, and all manner of lofty themes. Only the film never actually explores any of them..Unfortunately, like a lot of the ideas, they never really capitalized on it and the idea was ultimately just forced into a simple plot device to move things along..Maybe every generation gets the RoboCop it deserves. Im just not sure what we did to deserve this one. , A sleek, mechanical film missing the brain, the heart and, most of all, the balls that powered the first one..I cant really figure it out. From what I saw on the screen, nobody else could either. , For Padilhas run of the mill RoboCop, the metal head crime stopper is barely worth his arresting appeal."

Full Review in Spanish.A flawed experiment with a heart of gold..The action in Speed Racer is top notch in every sense, as though everything the Wachowskis worked on in the Matrix trilogy was simply a warm up..An excellent cast, story and visuals combine for an adrenaline fueled experience. Go, Speed Racer.It seems less a commercial strategy by the Wachowskis as a philosophical one to incorporate as many forms of communication and color blind ethnicity as possible, much as they did with the Matrix pictures..Amid the overly earnest tone, almost squeaky clean humor and familiar messages about teamwork and integrity is the rare film family thats as strong at the start as they are by the end. , This is Wacky Races powered by Enzo Ferrari and designed by Andy Warhol candy coloured carnage with a turbo charged engine..The filmic side effect of eating an entire bowl full of sugar, Speed Racer is designed entirely with one audience in mind, and despite its best efforts its not going to appeal to anyone else. , What grounds the spectacle, pushing it beyond a two hour ejaculation of sensation, is its yearning for innocence.Fellow critics mercilessly denounced this dazzling, visually inventive adaptation one of the ten best films of 2008.Twelve year old boys should be wowed, but for the rest of us, it will depend on your appetite for eye candy..A flashy, colorful film that packs a ton o fun into its fast paced frame."

Full review in Spanish , An unimaginative recital of car fueled multiplex cinema... Full review in Spanish.With all of these twists, turns, and frequent mood and setting changes, Knight and Day comes across as confused to what kind of movie it wants to be..Bland, forgettable, expensive action....As a time waster, Knight and Day is entertaining enough. It sets the bar low then clears it effortlessly. But as I creep into the damning with faint praise department, reviewing this film feels as pointless as watching it..Even if you like this kind of thing, you still have to be in the right mood for it. If you dont like this kind of thing, you dont need me to tell you to stay far, far away. , You dont have to be an industry expert to see that the biggest problem with Knight and Day is that the filmmakers quit working before theyd turned a good premise into a good movie. , Knight and Day is fun enough something like a toothless Bourne Identity, in which a federal superagent Cruise is pursued through the streets of fancy olde Europe for a crime he only sort of committed..Knight amp Day was not the triumphant return for which Cruise was hoping..Knight and Day is a bit too long one too many plot twists that made you just not care by the end but its fun though predictable thrill ride. , Knight and Day doesnt revolutionize the spy genre, but its an entertaining, pleasant distraction with fun performances by Cruise and Diaz. , A broad, boring comedy bogged down with a plot that doesnt seem to matter much, even to the participants. , hits all the beats youd expect from an international thriller , Scattered and uneven, this action drama wastes a terrific Tom Cruise..Its a calculated, artificial formula for box office success barely disguised as a story."

Not bad, not great, just... fine..Its really just a techno action movie and a crap one at that paying lipservice to the conventions of the Bond movie. , As Bonds go, though, Tomorrow Never Dies is pleasant enough brain candy, although Brosnans efforts deserve better... maybe next time, Meester Bond. , Director Roger Spottiswoode serves up a glutinous mix of pastiche and parody, without seeming to know whether hes recycling or debunking his cliches. , Despite the films faults, David Arnolds score, which layers industrialised sounds over traditional orchestration, can make some sequences seem more exciting than they actually are. , Brosnan gives it his best and with Yeoh, hes got a capable dance partner, but this 007 edition felt like a retread story that was already old news. , Tomorrow Never Dies is as overproduced as one of Carvers cable broadcasts incredibly noisy, flashy and busy without being terribly exciting. , Flaws aside, this was at the time the best Bond movie since the heyday of Mr Connery."

Woodley makes this bearable, but she cant save it , Insurgent falls short from its predecessor. Its heavy handed themes lend themselves to overworked storylines and the lack of any true impact. , Did all young adult science fiction authors of the last decade get together before writing their novels and determine to start with the same basic plot.Its biggest weakness is its inability to stand out from the pack, resulting in a story that feels bland and lifeless..Insurgent is better than its predecessor, Divergent, but thats hardly a compliment. It struggles to tell a messy story that even its clunky, expositional dialogue couldnt help make sense. , Maybe we are all getting Dystopia Fatigue, but I need more to care about if im going to wade into this level of despair. , The plots a bit stretched out, but good performances and the series impressive production value mean its a serviceable stopgap before the real action of Allegiant. , If youre able to push aside the confused machinations of the larger plot during the scenes of flashy violence, you may be able to find a bit of enjoyment in Insurgent. Beyond that, there isnt much nice to say. , Insurgent seems to indicate that the studios are content to simply go through the genre motions with this one. Whatever promise was offered by the first film is largely gone, leaving the franchise to plod to the finish line..Will I see them both Probably. Im a completist, so I want to see this storyline to its conclusion. Do I recommend that others embark upon the same journey Probably not. Im not that mean. , Its a step in the right direction, but Im still waiting for the film to deliver on its promise. , Insurgent is the halfway mark of a series, and, despite the dazzle, it failed to deliver the excitement or intensity that the first film however na ve promised..Sadly, the better than okay performances cannot salvage Insurgent from being dull beyond recognition..All just a tad bland, predictable and yawn inducing..The romance in this movie is SO bad."

At least you can tell video game characters apart..The Smurfs is a cute family film that suffers from being a little formulaic and uninspired, and the CGI smurfs dont look like the original characters. , Filmgoers who enjoyed the cartoon or comic strips as a kid will very likely be left with the taste of sour Smurfberries..The kids might enjoy it, but The Smurfs is nothing but an annoying, noisy commercial for Sony products. Save for Hank Azarias amusing take on Gargamel, the film is fatty junk food. , Peyos much cherished creations do little to nothing for me, and I cant say spending a 102 minutes with them in a live action computer animated hybrid was all that high on my personal to do list. , ...a cynical extension, not even an earnest spin off..The Smurfs is a cute film . . . if cutes your thing. , Once in awhile, a movie sets me searching for its origins.

Full Review in Spanish.I hope I never have to watch it again..This bouncy Western musical comedy adventure is long enough on charm, but wisely short and sweet at 76 minutes. Its also totally bereft of innovation... Blu ray , Not a classic, but cute and fun for families..Freed from the tyranny of dimensionality and realism, the animators indulged in one of the most goofy, silly, cartoony projects made at Disney in years..Assorted movie in jokes should keep parents tolerably entertained, and Alan Menkens songs mercifully favor western swing over the expected twang pop. , At last the humble cow has been recognised for more than simply gracing Gary Larsen cartoons.....only very small children will be able to label it anything more than a pleasant diversion..Adults will enjoy saddling up and going for the ride possibly even enjoying this moo vie more than your kids. Its udderly hilarious , One mustnt carp too much the film unfolds at a sprightly pace, making it fair fodder for undemanding sproglets. , The screenplay, however, smacks of desperate studio executives who are out of touch with todays audience. ,.If you have children, I think they would like it."

That’s basically what you get with Real Steel... , Real Steel may be a science fiction sports movie but the heart of the story comes through the family drama..Its a surprisingly effective and entertaining techno sports, father son, human drama. , I can see myself stumbling across it while trying to find something to watch on late night TV. Id stop to watch a scene or two, and then quickly move on , The ending is predictable and played out with all the drama thats typical throughout the film. Id say director Shawn Levy missed the mark on the target audience for this one. , Even though the story is paint by numbers and there really isnt anything new being done in this it is still pretty enjoyable. , Though initially targeted at younger teenaged boys, Real Steel has somehow made more of itself and become a feel good movie about redemption both families and adult escapists will applaud..Real Steel has box office bomb written all over it and yet, miraculously, it is one of the finest family films I have seen in many a moon..It was nice to be totally surprised by a big budget movie..Real Steel earns every single laugh, every single tear, and every single gasp from its audience..With its tale of redemption, reconnection and triumphant underdogs interwoven with seamless effects boasting a palpable physicality, Real Steel does nothing new but does it well..Its more of a throwback to Horatio Algers Ragged Dick, a rags to middle class respectability tale about the humble joy of old fashioned decency. , Its a film that captures the ethic of those Amblin movies, adding buckets of imagination, too. , Real Steel is real fun get your bot in the ring.Its as corny as Kansas, but the mix of old fashioned heart and new fangled animatronic cyber tech will make this picture a winner for fathers and sons. , I dont know where robot boxing falls on your moral spectrum, but Id take a pre teen to see Real Steel, as long as we had a long talk afterwards about the evils of product placement. , All things considered, it is a well wrought piece of entertainment, confidently paced, although its necessary subplots are little more than dutiful filler sandwiched between fight sequences..A feelgood film about family, friendship and growing up, Real Steel was always going to attract cynicism but it really does a fine job of delivering for a young audience..You can guess where the movie goes."

Full review in Spanish.It was fun, it was fluffy, it was entertaining, but I didnt think it was a great movie. , I was pumped up at the end..The almost octogenarian filmmaker has managed to set up a production that is a constant paragon of cinematographic virtues. Full Review in Spanish.Once again, mixing tragedy and comedy is not something that everyone knows how to do. Scott has plenty of talent not to fall for fashion. And yet he does.

She was right. , Give Eragon a few years By then, it might be delightfully bad..The title of Hollywoods latest fantasy epic is simply the word dragon with one letter changed, and unfortunately, thats about the level of creativity you can expect from Eragon. ,.An enjoyably bad movie..The effects are impressive but the script, acting and direction are desperately dull."

But wow, great effects, seriously..Tolkien lite..The viewer is not transported to the magical, complex and elaborate kingdom of Alaga sia of the book, but rather is merely observing action scene followed by action scene..While it offers nothing new, it gets a passing grade because it does have some interesting characters, brought to life by some top notch acting talent..We can only hope the next instalment will have a little more fire in its belly..John Malkovich finds his loopy, nostril flaring form as the wicked tyrant and Jeremy Irons, playing the boys wise mentor, is visibly thinking about his fee. , A painful reminder of what fantasy cinema was like before the Lord of the Rings trilogy re wrote the rules..Its a bonanza for the tinted contact lens industry."

Yet, for all that, it still doesnt have the charm of the brief original. , The advantage of adapting Maurice Sendaks slim tome is that there is plenty of scope for interpretation however, for the first time in his career, Jonze comes up short in the imagination department. , Jonze isnt always successful in his sometimes esoteric interpretation of the book. But his attempt shows that he has sensitivity to the smaller dramas of the human experience. , Its a quiet reminder of the power of scary ish stories, and its made with warmth, humor, and wisdom. , It is bewildering but not in an emotionally complex or troublesome way. Its bewildering in a narratively confused, narratively lost, we never figured out what we wanted all this extra stuff to add up to sort of way. , Fortunately, we have artists like Maurice Sendak, who remain unabashedly young at heart and wondrously capable of connecting with the child inside us all..Spike Jonze adapted a book with less than 200 words into a 90 minute feature and its simply wonderful. , What Spike Jonze is doing is trying something completely new, messing with the idea of what exactly a movie is, what a narrator is, what a filmmaker is, really, and doing it with a beloved franchise and a 80 million budget."

Now that the idea has been rinsed dry, it may well be time for these doddering die hards to be put out to pasture..Expendables 3 almost feels like watching a high school reunion, only without the self analysis and evaluation..Other than the more kid friendly format, the computer generated special effects have been amped up to ludicrous science fiction levels, perhaps to compensate for the lower adrenaline levels and less on screen blood..Is The Expendables 3 any good In its own way, I suppose.

A near perfect action film directed by Kathryn Bigelow with frenzied intensity, and it never seeks to patronise its own material or its audience..The film is far from perfect, but it’s perfectly entertaining..Action cinema is a populist genre that often struggles for respect among critics. It has always deserved better Point Break is a landmark for the field..This exhilarating movie runs on overdrive, offering an excess of stylish sequences and over the top performances that feel heightened by the radical and extreme behaviors on display..Much of the film feels as if an excuse for the cast to surf and skydive a curious combination of daredevilry.....a propulsive action film thats rarely been matched for in camera thrills and spills in the great outdoors.... , The change in Swayzes character in the third act soured this a bit for me. The inconsistency took away from the impressive action scenes and fun plot. , This is a very good action film despite some of the weird performances. It was very entertaining..Come for the guns and money, stay for the sun baked aphorisms and those big blue waves..Bigelow makes all this fun, tragic, and yes, deeply sexy without lingering too much on the bodies of the various surfers, male or female..Risky acts through increasingly audacious sequences, culminating in one of the most outstanding moments ever seen in the genre. Full Review in Spanish.While the critics may yammer, Point Break delivers the thrills, spills and crunches its action hungry audience demands..90s hit with intense action, graphic violence, and surfing. , A nearly flawless marriage of the genre clichs of the classic 80s model cop action picture with the elevated physicality of the 90s action films to come. , Did a dry California wind scramble the script as they moved into the third act Did the tape recorder go on the blitz at the story conferences Was there a fire in the editing room.This is a very macho movie, and if the better film schools are looking for a contemporary film that very keenly exemplifies the marriage of sound and shoot, this is it..Point Break is the best movie about cops, robbers, surfing and sky diving that youre likely to see."

A plain but still rewarding account of a true story from the 1820s..In the Heart of the Sea chronicles well a fascinating era in American history..Ron Howard handles this tale like a true master and his cast functions to perfection. Full Review in Spanish.If you can make it through those initially unpromising waters, Howard ends up delivering a fairly fantastic voyage..Harnessing the ability to portray the brutality of the sea and nature, accompanied by engaging performances from the entire cast, make this film one not to be missed."

Full review in Spanish.Best of all, the uniquely poignant, bittersweet reflection associated with Schulzs work is always to the fore. , I laughed at parts like the Kite eating tree and Snoopy singing or dressing as Joe Cool but I just dont think its something that is going to be considered a classic. , The voice cast of The Peanuts Movie, found through over 1000 auditions, adds immeasurably to giving it a place amongst the best cartoon specials..We can allow ourselves a little bit of that saccharine joy every now and then. For those moments, we have Charlie Brown and his gang....This film is a complete delight..Its a giant victory, not just as a movie, but as an example that Hollywood reboots dont always have to be obsessed with whats hip and new they can be old fashioned and unpretentious and still be as entertaining as anything else at the theater. , The film maintains the spirit of the comic strips intact..The story is simple and direct, a perfect introduction for the young audience The Peanuts Movie is clearly aimed for..The story is simplistic but executed perfectly, with enough heart and charm to make even the grumpiest of viewers crack a smile..Youve made a great film, Charlie Brown. , Sweet, charming, lovingly rendered, this is festive entertainment not to be sniffed at by dog or man..Youre going to love Snoopy.

Spectacular, brilliant, but punishing basically, one long brawl... , The visuals are strong, while the central narrative is weak a disastrous combination for a long movie . Worst of all, Gangs of New York achieves far too little while trying much too hard..Scorsese scores some fine political points along the way and demonstrates the mastery of his craft in every scene, but the underlying theme of brutal revenge at any cost loses its way too early on....One of Scorseses weakest films, a wannabe historical epic thats essentially a formulaic revenge saga, lacking unified vision and style. The only reason to see it is Daniel Day Lewis vividly compelling performance as Bill the Butcher. , A flawed masterpiece."

Its one of the strongest Dramas you can see this season. It isnt for the faint of heart though , The material is tailor made for Fincher, and, in many respects, it feels a summation of his work over the preceding 15 years..A twisty film that feels promising at first but then devolves into a sensational, lurid tale that rivals Silence of the Lambs for squirm factor..Rooney Mara inhabits the movies namesake Lisbeth Salander with such commitment and believability she captivates the audience and keeps our rapt attention for the slightly overlong 2 hours and 40 minutes. It is her movie. , The final product is a film of stunning craft if ungainly form built around a profoundly flawed foundation that even moments of individual brilliance cant fully save. , I was eager to see how an American version of this material would play out. Rather nicely, it turns out, thanks to the keen direction of David Fincher and a breakout performance from Rooney Mara."

Full Review in Spanish.For the most part this is a lyrical and lightly handled odd couple road movie that achieves a subtle resonance, although it is almost scuppered by a sudden major tonal shift in the films final act. , The subtlety of the film s elegant craft, the restraint of ulk s characterful screenplay, and the superb chemistry between the two lead actors ... gives The Interpreter a respectful, quiet resonance."

Full review in Spanish , With Blu and Jewel chained together like the hero and heroine of The 39 Steps , there are thrills, spills and gags galore..This is one film that you wont necessarily regret paying the extra bucks for the extra bursts of color and animation. , I found it quite charming..I ve never heard an adult say, I must go see that film. It has Jesse Eisenberg s voice in it. They could have spent the money on something else, like a better story..This isnt revolutionary animation, but its warm, sincere and huge hearted. I was dazzled by all the colors your kids are gonna go nuts for them. , While it may entertain the kiddies for a while, for the older folks out there and that means anyone 10 , Rio is just another animated yawner..Comical, colorful, wonderfully cast and beautifully animated, Rio is the first Blue Sky movie that could be compared to the best of Pixar..This is simply a film that both kids and parents can enjoy together, which, according to the consensuses for other recent kids films, hasnt happened for awhile, so my advice would be to take advantage of it , Basic, good natured cinematic charm isnt something that should be easily dismissed. , Bright and chippy as a roomful of parrots, and the best thing Saldanha has done since the first Ice Age..Rio combines excellent visuals and a witty, modern script that will appeal to audience members both young and old..Theres lots of color, some gorgeous animation, a running beat of lively if not always memorable music and the energy of lovely tropical birds in flight. The rest is formula... , This might be the first family film in which sex... serves as the narrative lynchpin..Even if the story lacks the depth or originality of some of the recent crop of superlative animated films, Rio has an innocent charm to it and an explosion of color. , The posters say From the creators of Ice Age, so dont say you havent been warned. , Since the little ones will be amused, the high flying Rio wont ruffle any feathers. , If the birds aren t precisely of a feather, as they suggest, they are bright and loud and alike enough to establish that this Rio is not real in any way."

Though Mumble's mom, Norma Jean, thinks this little habit is cute, his dad, Memphis, says it ""just ain't penguin."" Besides, they both know that, without a Heartsong, Mumble may never find true love. As fate would have it, his one friend, Gloria, happens to be the best singer around. Mumble and Gloria have a connection from the moment they hatch, but she struggles with his strange ""hippity- hoppity"" ways. Mumble is just too different--especially for Noah the Elder, the stern leader of Emperor Land, who ultimately casts him out of the community. Away from home for the first time, Mumble meets a posse of decidedly un-Emperor-like penguins--the Adelie Amigos. Led by Ramon, the Adelies instantly embrace Mumble's cool dance moves and invite him to party with them. In Adelie Land, Mumble seeks the counsel of Lovelace the Guru, a crazy-feathered Rockhopper penguin who will answer any of life's questions for the price of a pebble. Together with Lovelace and the Amigos, Mumble sets out across vast landscapes and, after some epic encounters, proves that by being true to yourself, you can make all the difference in the world.",positive,1.0,"Steve Martin said it best, Im getting Happy Feet , A surefire Oscar contender, come on and join the fun All singing All dancing All penguins Come on and get happy , Miller ensures that a conceit dancing penguins that might have seemed best left to the jokey attachments that clog up email inboxes is supple enough to carry a sardonic parable about the hypocrisy of Western consumers..Its very sweet but its also... really subversive and really weird. , The visuals in Happy Feet are absolutely amazing..Happy Feet will be remembered for its animation breakthroughs and fine voicing..Im the last person in the world to raise a stink about the environment...

Full Review in Spanish.You begin to suspect that Meyers isnt actually a movie director at all, but a features coordinator at World of Interiors. , Nancy Meyers pulls off a classic comedy tribute...the cast pull it off, selling their characters singlehood, nailing their occasional sight gags and earning our laughs and tears, which often occur in the same scene. , The Holiday is what you want out of a romantic comedy, without expecting the moon..Nancy Meyers is a whiz at turning out fun, frothy commercial fare..One of the best date movies I have seen this year..What makes The Holiday interesting and worth reexamining more than a decade after its release is that unlike most holiday themed movies, it exhorts the viewer to take time for themselves, not just others.

I found it to be a lot of fun..Clocking in at a pacey 96 minutes, Dredd 3D will satisfy fans as well as serve as a great introduction for newcomers to the character..It has just enough ambition to make a few modest statements about the nature of power and judgment without sounding pompous and its action is done well..An immaculate vision of MegaCity1.Dredd is a fantastic film laser focused, true to the spirit of the comic book character, and filled with ratcheting tension and killer hard R action set pieces..The verdict is in, and Dredd is an ultraviolent good time..Dredd knows its characters and world in a way that many adaptations do not and it blends them together with a not overly complicated narrative to deliver one of the best jolt to the brain action movies of the last year."

Full review in Spanish.A film that is so unintentionally bad that only Jamie Bell, as a renegade jumper, and the always impressive Samuel L. Jackson manage to survive with their dignity intact..Jumper cant make the leap from cool concept to good movie. , Jumper is a movie with no special powers. Despite its slick and sleek approach to extraordinary events, it remains quite ordinary and remarkably nondescript..A movie that has a tremendous premise and awesome special effects that are ultimately hindered by a script that prevents its characters from every fully taking off..Light entertainment is all about playing to an audiences fantasy. There have been quite a few well crafted and entertaining films that have started the same way and gotten away with it, out of sheer creativity. Jumper is not one of those films. , A better filmmaker would have given the material some kind of vertiginous rhythm, yet Liman just plods humorlessly, flavorlessly..Ignore the previews. Unless there was a drastic change of storyline in the editing room at the last minute, the final cut is a lot more interesting than originally advertised..Jumper is a popcorn movie, but without salt or butter. Too many of the kernels remain unpopped. Its like the Saturday matinees of yore. But by the time youve crossed the lobby after seeing Jumper, youve forgotten it. , An elegantly idiotic sci fi thriller that initially feels as though it might have derived from Philip K Dick but lacks the masters lysergic idiosyncracy. , Jumper is almost in too much of a hurry at times and logic and cohesion suffer as a consequence..Director Liman is a major talent. He deserves better material to mold..The movie isnt terrible and I certainly liked the superhero aspect of it, but the romance doesnt work and it has a rushed, sloppy feel throughout."

He needs a vehicle ahem that plays to his strengths. The Last Witch Hunter is definitely not such a vehicle..Even the considerable talents of Elijah Wood and Michael Caine cannot make this any more than another flick in which biceps give black magic a beatdown..The films world building suffers from too much ambiguity in the characters motives and history presumably saving them for a possible sequel , and the intricacies of the world are glossed over, making it all feel lifeless and fabricated. , The often incoherent and repetitive plot doesnt have enough thrilling action to redeem its other shortcomings."

The problem is the film doesnt have enough to maintain the interest of adults who come along with the kiddies. , Pacing is problematic there may be too much Minionism and too little relief. The comic set pieces arent threaded together at points, but there are many smiles to be had. , Its a film that both adults and children can enjoy together, and clever editing wraps everything up in 91 minutes the perfect timing for a family film. , Parents, I would recommend sending the kids with the babysitter to this one.

I was with them to a point, but once the story abandoned the quest to find a master it bogged down and the humor grew inconsistent..Life is short. Minions was fun. What am I supposed to do.Theyre essentially pantomime characters, but unlike, say, WALL E, the characters of limited speech here dont evoke a range of emotions. , Minions has a hard time holding up as a story on its own. Although the antics of Kevin, Stuart, and Bob keep the laughs coming, the story fizzles out in the middle..Rarely attempts to appeal directly to a grown up audience, instead concentrating all efforts on colorful, sophomoric spectacles and rambunctious escapades..Ill even admit that Kevin sits proudly on my desk at work while Bob, the enthusiastic young one, is staring at me even as I write this review. , Minions is a great idea, fairly competently executed, that ends up suffering at the hands of its own distributor ... All of the really funny moments that enticed me to come see the flick ended up being ALL of the really funny moments..Lets start with what Minions gets right Its a mercifully short 93 minutes long. But even at that length, it still feels padded. , The plot gets ever more convoluted, the jokes ever more lazy, hinging mostly on country stereotypes. Some of the best gags have zilch to do with either the story or the minions, come out of nowhere and lead to nothing..Considering that this prequel is a full length feature film about characters incapable of coherent dialogue, it certainly isnt as miserable as the calculated nature of its creation suggested. What a ringing endorsement, right , Everything about it is a weak excuse to give the Minions something outlandish to do, but there isnt a particularly strong thread running through any of it. , An endless roll of jokes ensures this is sublime dumb but smart entertainment..The worst thing about it is it just isnt funny at all and the story is all over the place. , This film should be prefaced by a warning message like you d find on a pack of cigarettes...

This project had all the resources to make a fine film, and it squandered them all, for want of a cogent screenplay..An empty shell..The central idea for Sphere is an intriguing one, but similar concepts have been much better executed on episodes of Star Trek, which makes one wonder why movie writing is allowed to be so bad..Word pointless is the one that should be attributed to this whole film, one of the worst to come from Hollywood in past decade and one that would test patience and temper of the audience like few others. , Lets face facts Michael Crichton is a hack. He comes up with innovative concepts, but his characters are cardboard cutouts. Given the psychological foundations of the story, thats an egregious flaw, and the ending is absurdly dissatisfying. , If you want a better sci fi film go see Dark City. A better Levinson movie Try Wag the Dog..Packaged as a smart psychological drama, it gradually dissolves into a badly edited action thriller, albeit one obscured by a cast of top notch talent..For a movie of a novel written by Michael Crichton with such a capable cast, Sphere is quite a disappointment..Sphere yearns to be a philosophical epic but its final and only edict is so rudimentary as to barely exist man is not yet ready either intellectually or emotionally for the gifts E.T.s are willing to share with us. , You cant accuse the makers of Sphere of skimping on talent. If only they knew what to do with it. , The ending, though emotionally satisfying, collapses under scrutiny. This lack of payoff is a real flaw in a film pitched to a discriminating sci fi mentality..Sphere is not trashy, or silly, or exploitative a lot of talent has been used to good effect here. But in the final analysis, fine filmmaking cannot overcome mediocre material..We snuck guiltily into the almost empty theatre, already prepared to hate it.

The screenplay lacks depth and so does the conflict between characters..Im sorry they couldnt have relied more on the birdbrains at their disposal for a smarter story than a multimillion dollar, volatile pun fest. , Angry Birds could have been an unmitigated disaster, and it was a big relief to see that it didnt even come close to that. , Its lushly animated, genuinely hilarious at times and even comes with the all important message about speaking up for what you believe in. , Would have been terrible even if it managed to come out during the period of time when society might have been interested in it. Instead, its both terrible and deeply pathetic. , The film launches a barrage of avian and porcine puns, plus a flock of knowing pop culture references...

But ultimately it sinks due to its tiresome, long winded story. Even the ever likable Chris Hemsworth can t help it..Mann can stage a heart pounding action scene, and pulls off a couple of them here that spice things up when the movie starts to run a bit slow, but at 133 minutes the whole movie feels in need of a reboot..Tiresome CG visualization of data transferring between computers twinkles repetitively and music swells while the camera focuses on button keystrokes and scrolling code..It would be better seen as a satire of Manns own method, where the details and processes of criminality make way for the machinations of a plot run amuck. , Unfortunately for audiences, Blackhat is a dull, drab affair that, while occasionally slick, with a few moments of nice tension, carries little more than that to recommend it..A melodramatic chore that packs little to no punch..When Blackhat is good, it is very very good seriously, that climax tho. But when Blackhat is bad, it is as bad as what if Jason Bourne was a computer programmer sounds..A return to visual form for the aesthetically inclined auteur... but the film is littered with schlocky convenience, instances of miscasting despite committed performances, and, worst of all, its uniformly dull. , The plot is elegantly unravelled by Manns masterful hand, but the characters and their relationships are too lightweight to balance. Mesmerising and disappointing in equal measure. , Its still early in the year, but Blackhats careless, convoluted script and lazy performances could easily earn it a spot on the list of worst movies of 2015. , Its ugly, but purposefully so. Mann shoots his characters like theyre a ragtag band of warriors... Its both dizzying and disorienting creating an urgency thats maintained throughout the lengthy run time. , Unfortunately, the sluggish Blackhat is another stiff serving of the cyber techno crime genre that is becoming so awkwardly prevalent in modern day synthetic actioners..Arrives with such a resounding thud that one feels compelled to start a forensic investigation before the closing credits have even rolled..Blackhat is perfect if you re suffering from insomnia..Blackhat muddles the line between trying to be realistic and action packed fun, but instead comes across as a potential cure for insomnia.Manns problem is that, like other directors before him, he cant find a way to make cybercrime look very interesting on screen."

Its also brainless, heartless and soulless. , This breezy movie is more fun when it doesnt worry about saying anything important and lets the zany antics unwind. , Despite its evil theme, Despicable Me is likable and heartwarming family entertainment..The main goal in Despicable Me is to tell this story with as little sap as possible, and on that it fares well."

First time director Neal Slavin has the kind of eye for color one would expect from an award winning photographer..No actor in the movies could have played this part better than Macy..This wearying dramatic thriller is one of most heavy handed films to come out during a particularly unsubtle cinematic year..Its earnest but heavy handed ... and seems quaintly dated. , Focus may not be an important film, but its an easy pill to swallow. , Performances, the storys historical origins, and the inherent goodness and contemporaneity of its storyline make Focus a movie worth viewing. , Despite the filmmakers best intentions, a story that once may have seemed daring feels predictable and unrewarding now. , What were left with suspiciously resembles a moderately clever episode of The Twilight Zone. , It is as heavyhanded as it is compelling, taking the subject of discrimination and turning it inside out, adding a new slant on corrupt thinking."

In any case, Fight Club remains the ugliest, most inhuman film since Natural Born Killers..The films tongue is far too firmly in its cheek at all points of its discourse to ever take its characters actions too much at face value. , The movie demands a certain attention and is not easily dismissed, but there is something deeply unsettling about a work that uncritically espouses brutality as a function of alienation and nonconformity..An outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload, Fight Club is the most incendiary movie to come out of Hollywood in a long time.

By the umpteenth variation of mistaking Calvin for a baby the joke has long, long stopped being funny..In spite of the admirable effort that the Wayans brothers went to in digitally transplanting Marlon Wayans head and facial expressions onto the two foot six inch body of a nine year old actor, Little Man is a bawdy and violent comedy that rankles more t.The work of the Wayans brothers, Little Man is even less funny than their last comedy, White Chicks, and enough to get them permanently evicted from the house of mirth..A slap happy misadventure featuring Marlon Wayans as a foul mouthed midget masquerading as a baby in order to retrieve a pilfered diamond from a childless couple..Slathers itself in scatology, crotch punching, hilarious elder child abuse, and a brutal ration of unearned sentiment..There are some films that are hardly worth the trouble of watching once youve got the central concept, you can pretty much run the movie in your head. , Mere words, mere permutations of 26 paltry letters, are an inadequate resource for explaining how fatuous, unfunny, and profoundly un entertaining it is to watch Marlon Wayans doing a goo goo ga fake baby routine..Slow moving, tasteless and totally devoid of ingenuity or charisma, this is a gross one joke monstrosity and that joke wasnt very funny in the first place. , The Wayans filmmaking clan strikes with another idiotic compilation of bodily function gags and lowbrow obnoxiousness masquerading as hip comedy..Its a concept, not a movie. , Abysmal comedy thats nonsensical, frequently offensive and almost entirely laugh free. , If your taste runs to scatology and you find little people inherently funny, Little Man may be the movie for you..Could you really have expected better from the people who made White Chicks.The Wayanses collaborate on another forgettable farce drenched in vapid vulgarity... a pea brained prank. Anyone game for White Chicks II.I understand the satirical import of the race gags. But 97 of the movie will make you need a shower.

It might also just be the years best film. , Only in Quentin Tarantinos mind is the idea of filming a western as violent, as entertaining and as original as The Hateful Eight. Full review in Spanish , Tarantino has created a highly immersive world populated by fully fleshed out characters, but hes also made a movie thats incredibly cruel. The third act, in particular, is chock full of cruelty... , There are a hundred reasons why a three hour widescreen epic that devolves into an Agatha Christie play shouldnt work, and yet... The Hateful Eight comes off as more satisfying than Inglourious Basterds or Django Unchained. , The Hateful Eight still stands head and shoulders above most other fare on offer in cinemas right now, and its a worthy addition to the Tarantino library. , It takes something special like a Tarantino film to relive that trembling magic of the cinema..The Hateful Eight is ambitious, complex yet wildly entertaining. For a 187 minute film, its worth it. , The Hateful Eight contains the traditional Tarantino values of racism, violence, and controversy but sets itself apart with brilliant cinematography and classic, mysterious story telling..Now, This is how you make a movie , The Hateful Eight is not just a movie. This is an experience. And thats exactly what Director Writer Quentin Tarantino was aiming for. , The Hateful Eight is a unique cinematic experience that transcends most of the best films of 2015. Instead of solely being a good film, it goes beyond that, resting its roots in the past and its ambition in the future."

Xerxes waited for 10 days for King Leonidas to surrender or withdraw but left with no options he pushed forward. After 3 days of battle all the Greeks were killed.

Headey is terrific, put her in charge of the Ancient World right now. , Whats really striking about the film is that it doesnt even have the aesthetics of a comic book, to say nothing of a graphic novel the best examples of which, at least, show considerable concern for subtle narrative rhythms. , If youre in the mood for dumb, rousing, visceral excitement, youre not going to find anything on the big screen right now to rival it. , There is an intelligent movie to be made about Spartan warrior culture, but 300 is not it. It is a fun ride, though, as long as you dont see it on a full stomach. , Our instinctual desire to sneer at the implausibility of the story is stalled by a sense of ambition that seems unmatched even by the standards of the Hollywood assembly line..Wallowing in the same adolescent nihilism as his Sin City, this adaptation of Frank Millers graphic novel suffers from a similar lack of momentum. , As the first blockbuster of the year, 300 sets the bar high enough, and is enjoyably silly..If 300 represents an evolution in virtual cinema, then at the same time it tells a story that transports us back to the violent roots of western civilisation. , Awesome.Visually thrilling and viscerally satisfying."

Goldeneye epitomizes that phrase..The interplay between Alec and Bond, the cast of oddball characters, the great set pieces. GoldenEye enjoyable for its entire runtime..With a dynamite opening reel that showcases the series renewed vigor, GoldenEye is two hours of well executed thrills, high tech mayhem and one of a kind comedy..Some elements of the story are a little silly though I love Famke Janssens portrayal of Xenia Onatopp, her psychopathic, nymphomaniac pathology is slightly comical. , GoldenEye, the 17th in the series and first in six years, gives 007 a new lease on life. Pierce Brosnan is no Sean Connery, but he is the best Bond since Connery started it all with Dr. No in 1962..Its a thoroughly fun film overall, though, and ranks as something of a forgotten gem 25 years later. , With the ideal Bond, a worthy adversary, gorgeous Bond Babes and a director skilled enough to fully maximize their potential, this stands atop the rest as the best Bond film..It contains four or five humorous, intricately choreographed action sequences that while not as riveting as similar episodes in True Lies or Die Hard With a Vengeance are enjoyable on that idiot level that even critics possess..James Bond, the British spy with a taste for the high life and a license to kill, comes back in surprisingly hardy and supple form..Brosnans right there, born to play the part. Perhaps by design, he captures a bit from each predecessor the panache of Sean Connery, the cheeky humor of Roger Moore, the serious grit of Timothy Dalton. , At the most basic, crowd pleasing level, Goldeneye does the trick..Giving 007 a sleek bullet of a BMW instead of his trusty old Aston Martin isnt exactly going to turn the world of Bond upside down. And, as it turns out, neither does the casting of Brosnan. , In GoldenEye, Brosnans performance achieves darker, Conneryesque tones. And the movies relatively realistic take on Bond realistic, that is, by the series flamboyant standards helps to give his work weight."

It features narcissistic, inward looking characters of no interest at all and amounts to a very poorly made film..Liz maybe the most unlikeable character Julia Roberts has ever had to play, not because co writer director Ryan Murphy is trying to make her so but because everything the film does pushes her in that direction..Julias late career seems an apologia for buying someone elses husband and getting away with it, for the most part, in the court of public opinion."

It’s too bad there isn’t enough surrounding the action to make this worthwhile..Even with the lowered expectations established by Antoine Fuquas original, the sequel, directed by Swedish filmmaker Babak Najafi, manages to underwhelm. , Instead of plausibility or watertight plotting, what you get with London Has Fallen is more Banning being Banning, which involves lots of takedowns of faceless assailants and macho, foul mouthed posturing that’s more often than not glaringly racist..This may be Gerard Butlers best action film yet. , If the film has, at best, a sub par screenplay, its storytelling woes are meaningless compared to the abysmal butchery it makes of its action scenes..London Has Fallen suggests the sort of film Leni Riefenstahl might have made had she bade Hitler Auf Wiederhesen and trotted off to enjoy a lucrative Hollywood contract under David O. Selznick..the underlying nastiness here aimed mostly at Arabs makes it feel like cheap propaganda a comparison not helped by shockingly shoddy special effects..Its not that London Has Fallen is hugely different from the original, just that its worst elements have been amplified. , The film is nothing more than a series of sub par kinetic sequences, tied together by a plot that is as thin as it is preposterous..Butlers secret service agent character Mike Bannon is a raging, murderous psychopath who takes every possible opportunity to shoot villains in the head and eyes. Specifically those places. , The jokes are dire, the politics dodgy, the hero a man from whom every president should run like the wind. But the main action sequence is well done in its scale and relentlessness and theres a terrific product placement for free British tap water. , I may not have liked Olympus Has Fallen very much, but it felt like All The Presidents Men compared to this sequel. , Not only an inferior sequel to Antoine Fuquas devastating city symphony of mayhem, Olympus Has Fallen, but its a contemptible, ugly and morally corrupt poser of an action film. , London Has Fallen is the Invasion USA of the 00s. Make of that what you will. , That some people will truly enjoy this movie is as damning a cultural signifier as anything."

Shooter is about government corruption vs. Marine corps integrity. It s not deep, but it s fun..Imagine a Rambo remake directed by Fahrenheit 9 11s Michael Moore while high on crystal meth. , That Shooter is far better than can be expected is down to the excellent direction of Antoine Fuqua. He marries action movie clich s with a subversive sense of paranoia and humour..Shooter is nothing special, but a combination of appealing performances, intriguing plot twists and exciting action sequences mean that were never less than entertained. , Theres enough unsettling paranoia that you dont exactly know how its all going to turn out. It feels more like it could have come from the early 70s, when happy endings might not necessarily be right around the corner. , Gory vigilante political thriller for adults only..Ultimately, its just a vigilante picture with ideas above its station. , A exhilarating, big budget action thriller about corruption, betrayal and integrity..

Thats to say one with crazy dogfights and no, really Nazis with prominent scars. , The finished product makes a great case, perhaps the best yet filmed, for remaining anonymous and achieving nothing..Its an inspirational story and its infectious sense of camaraderie may well be an effective recruitment film for the U.S. air force. , Executive producer George Lucas brings a healthy dose of his Star Wars magic to the CGI of the spectacular aerial sequences..The true story of the Tuskegee Airmen, a squadron of African American second world war flying aces, is one of those amazing tales that you just couldnt make up."

Just dont go in with high expectations, as the script and direction are merely average. , Beautiful to look at particularly any scene containing Salma Hayek and has a zippy energy, but theres nothing going on underneath its attractive surface. , What you get with this film is an unoriginal concept using the backdrop of a resort to lure us to see a heist film where our time is only thing that was stolen..Like a holiday page turner, theres nothing terribly profound in this heist movie cum comedy, but the characters are likeable and its easy on the eye. , Thats when most of us sleep. , They forgot the r in caper.Devoid of a clever script and truly charismatic chemistry, it plays out as one big, glossy yawn..All polish trying to cover up an unsanded surface..... a hollow heist flick.

Phillips and Muse are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship; in the ensuing standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.",positive,1.0,"Greengrass puts you through the trauma and leaves you almost as shaken as the film’s protagonist when its over. , This story seems perfect for the conventional Hollywood big budget treatment. But to my surprise Captain Phillips steers clear of those trappings..Time has been kind to this meat and potatoes film, for quality never goes out of style..Captain Phillips is a great adult orientated thriller that has a wonderful sense of tension and a career best Tom Hanks performance. You owe it to yourself to see this..The film is a technical chef doeuvre. Its a study on the misanthropy of international piracy. Its a film thats far more evocative and thought provoking than its name suggests. , A terrifically tense thriller that is worth the price of a full seat, even though youll only use the edge. , Features exceptional performances, led by veteran actor Tom Hanks..Newcomer Barkhad Abdi, a Somali with no previous acting experience who beautifully captures both the desperate menace and the thoughtful humanity..Even though the ending is well known, the suspense is tangible, made through expert craftsmanship and authentic acting..Tom Hanks puts on one of the best performances of his career in Captain Phillips....Paul Greengrass assimilates the dramatic events of Captain Phillips, teaching us how modern pirates operate in these times with outstanding cinematic execution. Full review in Spanish.Theres too much waiting and overly dramatic reflection. But the film does finish with a thrilling flourish, and the details of the cat and mouse games at sea are quite riveting. , Nothing feels false and in its final 30 minutes Captain Phillips is damned near perfect..Mainstream films this good deserve to be celebrated, because they dont come along nearly as often as they should. , Its a compelling, ripped from the headlines drama that offers plenty of tension even if you are familiar with the story. , The Navy SEALS procedural is a bit of a jumble even as it comfortingly demonstrates American competence in the face of a standoff. Still, its the captains passion that gives the movie its emotional intensity. , Hanks excels as Phillips with his everyman persona..What makes Captain Phillips so gripping, apart from its visceral sense of danger, is that it daringly gives us both points of view..Works as a reasonably effective thriller, although, in retrospect, that seems more down to the inherent strengths of the scenario than any brio in the storytelling itself."

Date Night is the fun, lighthearted comedy that the two TV heroes needed to reclaim their box office status..One can only fantasize about what a comedy starring Fey and Carrell would be like if the pair did the writing as well.....

Thatll be enough for people with a taste for camp but like the art form it is named after the movie is all tease and no follow through. , Youll be hard pressed to find a more vibrant, energetic and musically inclined film this year. , Somewhere in this two hour campy homage to the Golden Age of musicals, I found the film won me over with its old fashioned and rather cornball simplicity.Burlesque cribs from any number of trashy pictures about showbiz, but its not nearly as much fun as Showgirls. , Burlesque is so old fashioned in its storytelling that it feels like what s happening inside the club is a time warp from 50 years ago, while everything outside the Burlesque Lounge feels like Dancing With the Stars present day in tone..In the end, Burlesque falls short in the originality and depth department but if youre in search of music videos masquerading as a movie, it just might be your ticket. Or soundtrack. , Sure, the whole thing is obvious and silly and ridiculous, but Burlesque is really comfortable in its own skin..Awful..Reminds one too much of Coyote Ugly. Full review in Spanish.Magnificently awful..And its this tension that rescues Burlesque a film cursed with being too competent to be a Showgirls style guilty pleasure, and too ropey to be really recommendable. , If Burlesque was just an Aguilera stage show, it would be completely satisfying. Unfortunately, movies require actual plot and dialogue and when it comes to both, the film leaves much to be desired."

But mostly, it looks and feels so much like a video game that some members of the audience will feel their thumbs twitching before the final reel..In the inventive fight scenes, Blades sword clangs, and there are sluicing sounds when it finds its target, all in keeping with the unapologetic bang blam pop comic book spin director Guillermo Del Toro brings to the film. , The original Blade movie was a chilling, gory vampire story, energetic and stylish all in all, a bloodthirsty success. The second ones chaotic and dumb and almost completely without thrills. , Its a fabulous looking package, elegantly orchestrated by del Toro, who has an unerring eye for undead iconography, which he takes to visually imaginative extremes. , It is directed by Guillermo del Toro by directed I simply mean he turned his camerawork over to the computer graphics surgeons who cut, slice, dice and vivisect the material to mount a gross eyeassault of CG sequences..Del Toro is a stylish horrormeister, and he has created an evocative, foreboding atmosphere. But only a fan of this kind of mayhem could find a way into the story. And only a critic, sworn to serve, could stick it out to the end..The frenetic fight scenes are too fast for non vampire eyes, but those familiar with the original should find plenty to like..No one seems to be having much fun, with the possible exception of Kris Kristofferson, who is back as Blades venerable human sidekick, Whistler. The film finds few variations on the themes of run, kick, chomp and gulp. , The world can always use another entertainingly trashy B movie, and Blade II fits the bill..Icky, bloody vampire sequel."

Does the chess-playing James have what it takes?",negative,0.0,"Theres never a break to build character, a pause to appreciate a joke, or cessations in the franticness to allow for explanations. , Essentially a CIA action thriller with your rather run of the mill buddy flick angle attached to it..A crime not just against cinema but all of humanity, its been a long, long time since a movie made me this mad. , From Paris With Love is dopey, slightly predictable and probably a little excessive. Its also a lot of fun. , Aside from a generic plot twist and a little clever banter between the two fellas, From Paris With Love fails to deliver the excitement to which the trailer alludes..This thing is fun. Dumb fun. Overdone fun..The goatee sporting, shaven headed Travolta throws himself around with gusto, and the action is bruising and bloody, but to a viewer on this side of La Manche, the films casually racist attitude to its non white characters is shocking. , ...a workable premise thats squandered from the word go... , If you like a violent, silly, frenetic style of film youll find plenty to enjoy here. , Suddenly Im nostalgic for Battlefield Earth. , Its stupid, its unoriginal, and it makes very little sense... but thats not all bad. , Travolta stuffs it up, again..Lacking any compelling style, attitude or storytelling..A fun, over the top action movie that doesnt care that its stupid and over the top. , Not even the pleasures inherent in watching John Travolta mug it up as a gonzo CIA operative bent on breaking things and killing people... are sufficient recompense for sitting through this by the numbers slog from the fevered brain of Luc Besson"

It’s all at once such an oddball movie and a towering achievement in animation I think one fuels the other. Hot take Shrek is a great movie.Turning the fairy tale genre on its head was a clever, if not totally novel, notion at the time, and Shrek still retains much of its ironic charm 20 years later.....Shrek has a positive message about accepting yourself for who you are..20 years later, Shrek remains a timeless animated classic thanks to its exceptional, highly entertaining story, which comes packed with a multitude of amusing moments, and marvelous, fleshed out characters that have you engaged every step of the way..Classic fairy tale fantasy. In some ways this 20th Anniversary Special Edition 4K HD blu ray release sharpens the relatively early 2001 CGI animation highlighting the processes flaws ..The most effective moments arrive in the form of clever visual gags related to well known fairy tales..Shrek is unashamed of its modern flourishes. At the same time, especially for young viewers, it works very well as a straightforward and quite funny fable. The animation, coordinated by directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, is impressive..With the perfect blend of storytelling, animation, and music this is one movie Shrek the whole family can enjoy.Unfortunately when you take out the humor there isnt that much going for it. , The first Oscar for Best Animated Feature went to Shrek, an absurd choice to those of us who believe that Pixars Monsters, Inc. was that years best toon flick. Still, this is nevertheless a snappy comedy that manages to stick it to the entire genre. , Murphy steals every scene hes in with equal parts bounce and warmth. , Here is a movie of the times, funny, enjoyable, perfect looking, and altogether original in a way that might cause us to look again at the meaning of the word..Adults will find plenty to laugh at. Children will love it..Shrek is alive, and with dark, sly and absolutely hilarious irreverence lampooning every once sacred characteristic of the nursery kingdom. Shrek is a subversive joy...With improbable finesse it buffs up some of the oldest tropes of storytelling and then gives them a mischievous tilt, so that we appear to be watching a celebration of a genre and a sneaky subversion of it at the same time..Even more amazing, for a movie with its share of flatulence gags, it also has a real heart. Few films have had their cake and eaten it so gleefully..The best jokes in Shrek spoof Disney tradition the villains lair looks suspiciously like a certain theme parks Main Street USA, and a bluebird of happiness explodes during a sugary crescendo. , Shrek qualifies as a classic animated movie, and one of the more charming films to grace screens in a long time..The storys simple, the quest not that complicated. But the joy of Shrek is in the telling, in the details along the way."

But this nostalgic look at movie making hits all the right spots for me..Its a by the numbers blockbuster, but one with a key element thats missing from most of the big budget bloatfests crowding each other for space on the marquee every summer heart. , Takes a winning formula and replicates it to a successful degree but very little originality finds its way into the film..A film that manages to remind us that the scariest monster flicks are those where we actually care about those who are involved..Super 8 is a bit of a frustrating movie. Its well paced, emotional, and captures a certain innocence of pre pubescent youth, without becoming too cheesy. , Abrams seems more concerned with emulating the Spielbergian way than mining the true emotion that can be felt..This might not be the most original piece of work, but its one of those films that show that sometimes familiar can be a good thing. , Super 8 is pretty much awash in charm..The kids are the true stars here."

I wish he could have been given more depth. , A great film about the business of baseball..Moneyball is definitely a movie for people who love baseball, but its also for anyone who is interested in how human beings perceive one another, and how those perceptions can be changed. , The movie is engaging and interesting and touching, as Beane struggles to bond with his daughter and right some wrongs in his past..Its not in any hurry to get anywhere and the climax doesnt quite satisfy, but there is enough snappy dialogue and rousing moments to keep you enthralled. , With Pitt and Hill swinging for the fences, Moneyball does more than just get on base. And as we ve learned, that s the key to winning the game..Its mostly the Pitt show."

Full review in Spanish , Clint Eastwoods latest movie opens with a spectacular natural disaster, an awesome scene inspired by a real event that takes the viewers breath away. After that, disappointingly, this earnest drama about the afterlife is a bit of a plod. , The films leads either cant quite grasp what Eastwoods trying to accomplish here or they themselves dont resonate with his seemingly hands off approach to the after life. , Eastwoods entry in the supernatural genre barely works. Full review in Spanish . , The film is NOT for everyone, as it strikes raw nerves. If you can enjoy it for the cinematography, Eastwoods directing and the amazing locations, then you just might enjoy it as much as I did. , W hile performances by De France, Damon and McLaren lend some sparkle, given the strength of the talent involved Hereafter is, ultimately, a disappointment..A devastatingly misguided piece of work, significantly lacking in the sort of depth that it so surely believed itself to posses..Eastwood found a way to turn the whole thing into a big drag..The direction is utterly bland. The film doesnt care about its own subject matter, or have anything to say about it. , Aged 80 Clint Eastwood has made a film that is completely different in style, tone and structure from anything he has delivered before..Hereafter confronts a topic that could have descended into mawkish, mystical hokum, but not in Eastwoods no nonsense, uncynical hands. He looks at death, and beyond, with clear, open, inquisitive eyes. , Hereafter is another case of poor material, decent direction ..Food for thought, this movie may provide... but it fails to linger long after the end credits roll..Eastwood fails to infuse any moments of suspense or heart into the story and when all is said and done, Hereafter is an anticlimactic, sleepy and momentum less mess of a film."

Matt Damon sees dead people hes so modest we believe him. , As an understated melodrama it works just fine, as an exploration of human ideas of life after death, it comes up strangely short..Hereafter is steadily slow, but never loses my attention..Hereafter is pleasant, intelligent and consistently watchable, but it is also oddly diffuse..With the brilliant team of Eastwood and screenwriter Peter Morgan behind it, Hereafter could hardly be anything but a finely crafted, engaging film..More concerned with loneliness in this life than anything that happens after death"

They will see an allegory about power and politics and the danger of allowing either to run roughshod over humanity..This is not exactly standard childrens fare, but kids and their parents should be smitten by its wit and wisdom. , This is sharp, sophisticated stuff, appreciated on different levels by both parents and children, and even those who are neither. The film has impish humor, great adventure and more than a few thrills..Wisely, Bird and company eschew the standard Disney formula of catchy show tunes and cuddly animal sidekicks and lead Warner Bros. toward an animation style the studio can call its own..A magical evocation of a special time in history and a time in everybodys life when the dream and the nightmare quotients are equally high. , The Iron Giants theme of fear of the unknown is craftily balanced against the power of innocent imagination. , The film isnt as blisteringly satirical as The Simpsons its warmer.

It certainly gets the heart pumping, but theres nothing much for the brain to do after youve left the cinema. , A crime thriller that has plenty of familiar elements in play but also has an ace in the hole in the form of a dynamic lead performance from Bryan Cranston..Picture this as a Goodfellas with Bryan Cranston..Cranston is a joy to watch as he glides from Colombia to Miami to London, swirling whiskey in a crystal glass while flying on a private jet or smashing cake into the face of a waiter for bringing his wife the wrong order..The Infiltrator is a semi entertaining drug cartel film that allows for a two hour escape into its world of violence and high stakes suspense..I generally despise films that end in a wedding too lazy a finish for dippy rom coms. But this weddings pathos and suspense are unlike anything weve seen since The Godfather. The Infiltrator is a cinematic offer you cant refuse. , Bryan Cranston just has it. This now iconic character actor commands attention. , The Infiltrator introduces a dizzying ensemble of characters into its overstretched duration to weave a tale we already know too well..The daring Brad Furman is still looking for his style among Heisenberg and Narcos. Full review in Spanish.Although the ensemble and energy of The Infiltrator are good, the film as a whole comes up a little short..The film begins in 1986 and is based on a true story, and you have to wish that it had either been told earlier or, if it is to be told now, told with a lot more style..The Infiltrator is entertaining enough, and makes for solid summer counter programming..This is an Oscar worthy performance beautifully supported by numerous good actors for example, hes joined by John Leguizamo as the explosive and unpredictable Emir. , The Infiltrator is what I like to call a decent Saturday laundry film, something that you can put on, walk away from it and let it run on its own for about 10 minutes, return to it and not be lost at all."

Violent, barbaric, and untamed this was everything that James Bond decidedly was not. It was here that Daltons ideal of Flemings agent crystallized. , The level of violence is unlike any other of the series, making the chief antagonist more formidable, memorable, and ultimately less fun..Daniel Craig shows the grit, the determination and vulnerability that Bond has...Dalton did that years before.The movie is really well structured, simple in plot but rather meaty in delivery..Some of 007s earlier adventures fail to hold up, but in a post Taken world, Licence to Kill certainly aged well and is a under appreciated gem in the Bond catalog. , Licence to Kill gets better as it unfolds for more than two hours. It just takes an insufferably long while to find the right pace..Licence to Kill ranks as one of the best of the 16 Bond films, thanks to Daltons athletic, tough and deadly new 007. , As unlikely as it seems, Mr. Dalton actually appears to be growing in the Bond role, which is potentially stifling because its own popularity has so rigidly defined it..This series record of maintaining an admirable level of quality stays intact, even if this film might best be used as a cinematic appetizer to see before renting a tape of one of the Connery or Moore classics. , Every once in a while, the Bond series pulls in its stomach, pops the gun from its cummerbund, arches its eyebrow and gets off another bulls eye. The newest, Licence to Kill, is probably one of the five or six best of Bond. , He may look the part, but Timothy Dalton fails the boots, the scuba gear, or the automobiles left him by Moore and Connery..If the series is ever going to return to its Connery era glory, it definitely needs some new writers, ones who know how to streamline a story and keep the dialogue tight..Dalton revives the cool, ironic detachment of the Connery years, but he also allows a touch of obsession to show through Bond s surface aplomb."

In 8 Mile, that life becomes an equally riveting drama..Despite the predictable formula, screenwriter Scott Silver wisely avoids taking the easy route every time there are several small twists you may not expect, and the ending isnt entirely a happy one. , Because it rejects easy victories, this may be one of the few inspirational movies that could actually inspire someone, somewhere, sometime..The movie has some of the braggadocio of its white trash hero, building to its competitive climax as if it were a gladiatorial sporting event, and it carried me all the way."

On the plus side Johnson does her best with what shes been given, Ana is a Thomas Hardy fan, and Grey has a nice kitchen. , The entire palate of the film was cool and gray, which doesnt do much to incite passion. and I dont think we should blame the actors. , Fifty Shades of Grey is that hot date you bring home to discover s hes a cold fish between the sheets. , This is worth going to the cinema for, leave your expectations behind and relax and enjoy a visually beautiful film."

The result is, for Berg and star Mark Wahlberg, a career best endeavor..Its hard to watch at times, but you cant deny the emotional impact. , This appears to be the movie that its makers intended, but it still feels like a little more depth could have provided much more impact..Surprisingly, what makes this story hit home is the acting. All four men bring a quiet realism to their roles the less they think of themselves as heroes, the more we do..It... challenges the viewer to reconsider simpleminded moralizing when it comes to war action..The fact that war really is hell is always kept front and centre throughout. Tobia Schliessers cinematography is brilliant. This ones an adrenaline packed ride all the way. , Peter Bergs latest directorial effort, the Navy SEALs drama Lone Survivor, is no better than a limp retelling that fails to get underneath the surface of the actual story. , Its what an action movie should be at its best the shots fired are less interesting than the personal struggles of the men in battle. , Bergs film is beautifully shot and thrillingly paced he and his actors have a real affection for these men and feel a real duty to portray them honorably."

Its a touch long at 2 hours and 14 minutes, but it starts off with a wonderful bang as were dropped right into the Amityville fray. The fantastic camera work and creepy scenes sets the tone right away. , If youre a general wide audience for horror movies, you should see this one over almost any other release...this should set a standard for how studio horror movies are made. , James Wan outdoes himself with The Conjuring 2 by creating a true high budget horror film and successfully scaring audiences.

Each section of the train holds new surprises for the group who have to battle their way through. A revolution is underway.",positive,1.0,"This graphic novel adaptation is a blend of science fiction and social commentary that plays out like a video game... With it comes Chris Evans’ finest performance..It’s a visual delight..Thoughtful, provocative, and far more enjoyable than your average blockbuster, Snowpiercers pure entertainment value is outmatched only by its sobering commentary on the continual inhumanity of the human race. , If you needed any more convincing of Bongs versatility as a director, credit should be given to the fact that this is an English language film from a Korean director, that uses language and cultural perspective as a tool in the movies very storytelling..Snowpiercer examines a class system that refuses to die no matter the circumstances. Director Bong Joon ho constantly asks whether a person must accept their preordained place in society for the sake of balance and harmony..Part allegory, part Heros Journey, Snowpiercer makes no concessions about its religious and political metaphors, and it is all the stronger for it. , Its satire of actual class warfare is as cutting as the axes the rebels and guards use..An extraordinary work of climate change fiction, with bold visuals, gripping action, shocking violence and a brutally clear allegory for the class system..Its just as interested in examining topics like climate change, class, and cultural disparity as it is in revealing just how the films core team navigates a never stopping hell train to take on the bad guys. , An environmental thriller if you haven t already seen Bong s The Host do so now that is unapologetically weird, keeping the audience off balance for the entirety of its two hour running time..Overflows with ideas, encompassing the spectrum from vividly bizarre to profoundly mesmerizing..Insanely brilliant..It has plenty of action, while the story contains an unexpected intelligence. It has a message, but never gets too preachy. Its very violent, yet avoids being overly bloody. Its dark, but knows when to lighten the mood. , Bleak and grim and almost desolate, there is a spark of hope, just enough to keep the gloom and doom from becoming oppressive..It holds great promise yet never finds its track..A riveting mix of disturbing drama and edgy action, seasoned with sharp wit..I wouldnt really recommend it. , An electrifying, horrifying and witty study of society and class wrapped up in a sci fi action movie..Its a hot mess. , ...an extremely visceral experience, with much to say about contemporary western society. We couldnt expect anything less from Bong. Full review in Spanish"

What Daphne does not anticipate is that there ends up being a number eighteen, Johnny, who witnessed the interviews from the sidelines as the guitarist performing at the restaurant, and while Johnny did approach Daphne in his interest in meeting Milly from what he heard of the interviews, she immediately dismissed him solely because he is a musician and thus irresponsible by nature, much like her ex-husband.

The young actors are excellent. , An extraordinary childrens adventure... , Although it starts slowly, there are plenty of rewards in this well crafted family fantasy adventure, as it explores a world in which light bulbs form the sky and a powerful generator acts as its heartbeat..This well designed and executed piece of entertainment is actually very satisfying..Pure escapism fun, with plenty of stark visuals and inventiveness to go around."

As far as boxing films go, Creed is a masterpiece on so many levels. u200b.Though a smart and superbly shot film, the story structure follows a familiar and predictable trajectory for anyone acquainted with Stallones original. , Stallone shines once again as the dearly loved Rocky Balboa and hands over the gloves to Michael B.

Some actors get better with age. Others fade into the distance, taken over by younger talents never to be found again....Theres an incredible empowerment in Creed that speaks volumes to our current generation. With Stallone representing the past, he passes on the boxing and life metaphor torch to Michael B.

Jordan. Full review in Spanish , Rocky has always been about heart, and 40 years into the franchise, it would seem theres still plenty to spare. , Cynics could easily latch on to the problems above and dismiss CREED as franchise smelling salts. To do so, however, would be to also dismiss the new talent Coogler and Jordan bring to the creaking joints of the ROCKY brand..Were lucky to have Creed. With most franchises, the seventh installment wouldnt even be in theaters, much less worth a damn. , Placing focus on the young Creed allows Jordan to breathe his youthful talents into the film. He successfully carries the weight of being the main focal point..Creed goes the distance and then some..Ryan Coogler proves to be a great action director with his close, seamless fight shots, while capturing uncheesy sports montages and intimate interactions."

And crime. We know, unthinkable isnt it... , The performances are lively and the set pieces particularly the masks, which are a perfect touch are memorable..If you mixed Michael Manns Heat with Good Will Hunting, youd get this flick. , The Town isnt as impressive as Afflecks directing debut, 2007s Gone Baby Gone, but he handles the action scenes with brutal efficiency and gets terrific performances from his co stars. , An electrifying, emotionally involving, and visually satisfying crime thriller..The Town is a strong film made by a promising director whos only just starting to develop. , Good if banal..Ben Affleck proved hes a helluva director with a down and dirty heist movie rich with detailed character work and emotional angst. Jeremy Renner and Rebecca Hall are superb. , Affleck gets the tone mostly right his use of natural lighting in the films final stretch is impressive , but he has yet to completely find his footing as a director. , A Boston native, Affleck clearly has an understanding of the ins and outs of the neighborhood, and like Gone Baby Gone he brings that area to the screen with a rich story and strong characters..I promise youll enjoy every minute of it...maybe even enough to overlook the saccharine, melodramatic ending. , The ending, which could have swerved differently, is as realistic as it can be and it s just right at different levels..An authentic feeling, action packed adventure..So this isnt fresh, exactly, but it is tense and exciting and well performed and you do end up caring about the people youve been manipulated into caring about. I ask you what more could you want from a trip to the cinema , John Hamm, playing a character who should not have existed in the script, gives a performance so bad he looks as puzzled to be there as Jeremy Renner looks pissed..The Town is a definite must see..In between terrific action set pieces, The Town lightens the anxiety with some chewy, funny moments."

Even with sparkle vampires. , The orthodox blood drinking vampires...are about as frightening as snitty runway models, and are only there to threaten Bellas maidenly Type O so Edward can rescue her for the seven hundredth time. , Die hard fans of the vampire romance novel Twilight will be happy to know that the film follows the book nearly to the letter. For everyone else, however, this isnt good news. , In accordance with the adage about the rubbishy book making for the better movie, Twilight the film is great..Without descending into camp, Pattinson undercuts earnest intensity with a deft, self conscious wit..The sequels became increasingly silly and overwrought but the original Twilight 2008 is actually kind of interesting even if you are not a devotee of the fan fic turned bestseller series..Stewart and Pattinson have convincing chemistry as the star crossed lovers..Youve been warned. , Unless youre a 14 year old girl who gets all giddy at the thought of cute boys and first love, steer clear of Thirteen director Catherine Hardwickes anemic adaptation. , Yes, its strongly geared to the teen audience, but dont hold it against the filmmakers and go in with any preconceived notions and youll find it a fun opening chapter of a new franchise. , Its not the stunts and derring do which excite the senses as much as the quiet chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson that is guaranteed to get your blood up."

It bests its predecessor in most regards..Everything is more implausible and entertaining, even though the structure is the same. Full Review in Spanish.Superior to Octopussy.it shows that Connery is, for the moment, the actor who best treated the character, the only one who even took it seriously, possessed the necessary humor to make us laugh at him. Full Review in Spanish , Essentially, its a remake of the less successful Thunderball, also with Connery. but Never Say Never Again, in the original Bond spirit, concentrates on the people rather than the gadgets at least for the first half. , If you havent seen Thunderball, this is a lot more enjoyable, but matched up against one of the more exciting 007 films, Never Say Never fails to do it better. , Never Say Never Again is the best acted Bond picture ever made, because it clearly surpasses any predecessors in the area of inventive and clever character delineation..Its not a rap against Roger Moore to say that this film seems to bring James Bond back to life. Sean Connery did, after all, define the character. , Sean Connery is still up to par as James Bond in the latest adventure of Agent 007..The plot, which owes much to Thunderball, lurches badly at times, but the wild action set pieces, decked out in gals, gadgets and glib lines, are there to be cherished."

The makers should have been more adventurous instead of simply trying to beat Broccoli at his own game..A fitting farewell to 007s most enduring embodiment as much a playful send up as a loving final embrace. , Can we just consider 1983 a lost year for James Bond First, Octopussy, then Sean Connery s return in a depressing dilution of the 007 brand one that ends with a fourth wall breaking wink indicative less of arch fun, more of bored indifference..I know Bond fans were furious about this movie cause it wasnt an Eon production, and I think theyre wrong. They should be furious at it because its a horrendous film. , The slick production values impress and Barbara Carrera and Klaus Maria Brandauer are good value villains, but Irvin Kershner appears to have nodded off in the directors chair. , In Never Say Never Again, the formula is broadened to accommodate an older, seasoned man of much greater stature, and Mr. Connery expertly fills the bill."

Full review in Spanish.Those of a certain age will find this an enjoyable blast back to the past..Hot Tub Time Machine is a joyously R rated, surprisingly insightful yet uncontrollably outrageous film..Even though all it is meant to be is a loving send up of 80s comedy, all it really does is make one long for the real thing. , Hot Tub Time Machine is more than just a chance to poke fun at the decade of excess. There is actually a sweet natured message about friendship buried deep within a film that isnt afraid to push its R rating as far as possible. , There are genuine moments of raucous hilarity to be found in this film, mainly from the outrageous performance of Rob Corrdry..You might not fall out of your seat laughing, but the film is consistently enjoyable from start to the very clever and amusing finish and with its brisk 93 minutes, its worth taking a dip in this tub. , What Hot Tub Time Machine critically lacks is any sense of wit in its humour. Vomit, urination, male nudity and gay panic jokes take up a large amount of the films time. , Heres the biggest question in a movie built around them Why isnt Hot Tub Time Machine a full on parody of the culture or at least the movies that the characters revisit , Like most guy centric films these days, this film is ragingly homophobic and misogynistic, and you know what These are some of the best parts. It is a testament to the wit of the writers and the charisma of the cast that we are never turned off..If the filmmakers had thrown in some variety, it might have worked, because Im sure they were going for more than just a feeling of indifference. , Those drawn in by the name will surely get exactly what they expected and then some..It not only wears its absurdity as a badge of honor, but quite literally looks us in the eye and dares us not to laugh."

So the point of the film isnt the foregone conclusion, but the journey, which is... bland. , The aquatic photography is very good and there feels like genuine emotion for Winter. Its formulaic and predictable, but hey, it sort of has to be. , While the kids talk smart, there is a bit of a condescending tone to the script where some good old fashioned science might have been more effective..Barely there Morgan Freeman and Kris Kristofferson pick up the easiest paychecks of their careers, while top acting honors go to Mavis the sea turtle and Rufus the comic relief pelican..... wholesome and occasionally moving but hardly memorable..You can have all of the big name stars in a film that you like. But when your co stars are dolphins, not to mention an acting pelican and an impossibly cute sea turtle, you are always going to be playing second fiddle..It doesnt have the focus or splash of the original, but Charles Martin Smiths sequel winningly wears its heart on its sleeve and Winter plays herself to a crowd pleasing tee. , A shapeless and aimless film is padded out by a trite coming of age plot involving Nathan Gamble as Sawyer..In the end, its the feel good animal antics that will appeal and keep the audience on edge once peril rears its ugly head. , Mild fun ensues, but even the returning players cant divert us from all its narrative water treading ..."

Its a total button pusher, but it does so in a very good way. , Football may the thread that runs throughout, but the movie is much more interested in the tale of how Oher left behind a life of poverty, violence and foster home despair to become a champ on the gridiron..A living tribute to fundamental Christian motivations, although the point is hammered home with an extraordinarily soft touch Love thy neighbor..Sing it together with me my brothers, thank the Lawd for he created the white man that he might teach them po negroes the value of good Christian chariddy. , While The Blind Side constantly threatens to deteriorate into sentimental saccharine, it never does.

And Im already having a hard time remembering anything else about It. , Satisfying on a basic, fun level, but also stylishly produced and not insulting to the viewers intelligence. , The movie, idiotic as it is, has its charms, thanks in large part to its two main actors..Gordon Levitt is, as usual, a likeable hero, though hes underused in a film thats plainly more interested in kinetics than drama. , Just a few spokes short of a wheel, guys."

But following a long line of tepid popcorn flicks in 2014, The Maze Runner is more notable for what it does right than what it does wrong..Even after having seen the movie, I still feel like I know nothing about the world being presented here.Overall, The Maze Runner is a solid piece of science fiction that features an interesting story and some compelling visuals..The climax might seem underwhelming for some but the build up is a sure shot winner. Deserves a sequel....This film, based on a best selling young adult novel, works so well because the story comes without the traits that viewers have come to associate with young adult fiction..The Maze Runner is a well told story in its own right, but many of the parts will be familiar. That said, this cross between the Lord of the Flies and The Hunger Games leaves you wanting more."

The Fountain speaks volumes..Told in nonlinear fashion, the story keeps us waiting for revelations about whats really going on but these are few and far between. This problem is exacerbated by the artificiality of just about everything that we see. , As with his other films, The Fountain is a labor of love for Aronofsky, and it shows. If you prefer intellectual and challenging fare, by all means, go and see this one..Wolverine Man Jackman works nobly in the three parts of his trinity..Perhaps in twenty more years or so, The Fountain will be recognized for the utterly gorgeous masterpiece that it is..Visual alchemist Darren Aronofskys most personal work is a double helix of love and loss death entwined with life as existences only reliable truths. It offers a transfixing merger of biological imperatives and musings on creativity and tragedy. , Its difficult to recall another American film that, in pursuing a passionate and personal vision, goes so maddeningly, uproariously wrong. , A metaphysical muddle..The continuous sense of deeply felt discovery tempers the movies overreaching pretentiousness , You can judge for yourself whether a money shot of semenesque tree sap is a proper payoff, but the movie is at least texturally rich, tonally consistent brooding, always and much fussed over by its maker..Its a simple story told with Zen directness, its fingers deep in the age old questions, its eyes and ears wide open to the sensual potential of cinema. , So simple, so elaborate, and yet so utterly brilliant....Despite its flaws, its still worth watching. , Seldom in cinema has eschatology been treated with such intelligence, or inspired such aching awe."

Too many screens of blinding lights. Too many transitions for their own sake. Abrupt changes of tone."

Carol could be any of us when put in the right situation. , In her first lead role, Julianne Moore delivers a dazzling performance as Carol White..The surreal, detached nature of Safe puts it firmly in the horror genre, even while tackling urgent issues that haunt us all. Moore, as always, doesnt flinch. Its a movie and performance that will have you questioning everything. , It may very well be Haynes most invigorating work precisely because of all the avenues of projection its fascinating obliqueness provides. , Haynes does to us what his film does to Carol, cannily exploiting our willingness to find answers where there are none, to read meaning into associations..I found Safes lack of answers both intriguing and frustrating. , Intended to be an exploration of the attitudes and anxiety surrounding the AIDS crisis, Safe still possesses the ability to leave viewers breathless and squirming in their seats..One of the all time great films. Screams out with existential terror showcasing how the lack of identity is not only anxiety inducing but potentially inevitable due to the modern world we live in..In many ways, Safe predicts both the insular nature of contemporary society, and the counter intuitive disease of conformity thats synonymous with it. , For all its disquiet, Safe is truly about the terror of losing control or, even more frightening, being made aware of the fact that we never had control to begin with..Safe is brilliant for the way Haynes, with cinematographer Alex Nepomniaschy and composer Ed Tomney, blankets the mundane in the eerie tone of science fiction and horror..Moore, evidently under Haynes instruction, gives a performance composed of near total inertia. Her pale lifelessness meant to be frightening, I suppose is merely irritating. , Moore, in a nearly unplayable role, is amazingly vivid and touching this is a heartbreaking portrait of a woman in full, panicked retreat from life..Frequently fascinating, it never builds into anything profound..Safe is numbingly fascinating, partly due to its carefully composed, antiseptic visual style and its throbbingly threatening soundtrack..Youd have to be cranky or blind to deny Haynes artistry and vision. Theres a dark power, a tremor that runs through the movie like the rumble of a secret dread. , Beautifully constructed, chilling internal nightmare where every scene plays out like a little mini movie in and of itself. Brilliant..This creepy art movie will stay with you."

This is the End is the years current champion of funny. , I cant even tell you.

They seem to forget that if theres not a good story and characters in place to carry those extra elements, none of them will matter. ,.A mini Michael Mann effort populated by one dimensional clichs..No ones asking a low priority contemporary robbery movie to be Rififi, but theres such a thing as striving for some kind of quality that will set you apart from the anonymous pack. And no one thought to do that here. , Not even a good effort from Matt Dillon who seems to play the hard done by cop security guard for the umpteenth time here can provide this stodgy outing with the caffeine kick it is sorely in need of..The film borrows from dozens of classic heist pictures, but adds very little fresh, original or exciting to the mix..Mindless mayhem perfect for fans of pyrotechnics for pyrotechnics sake.A consistently unwatchable actioner....Laughable subplots about Elbas addicted sister Marianne Jean Baptiste and Dillons crooked partner Jay Hernandez only slow the action, which is all this movie has going for it. , Borrows from its genre without embarassing itself. , It all crumbles into a series of chaotic gun battles filled with shaky camera moves and excessive noise..Marks the on screen collision of Hayden Christensen and Paul Walker, two actors so charmless and wooden this reviewer feared their combined presence would result in the creation of a charisma black hole that could wipe out the universe..Noisily vacant."

The characters are few and the settings limited, such that complex ideas can peacefully exist inside the film, without tying the narrative in knots. , If you can overlook the pseudoscientific explanations...youll be treated to a trippy, head spinning sci fi drama with amazingly organic, human characters at its core. , As science fiction, its a little shaky. But its definitely worth seeing Duncan Jones has delivered an entertaining, fast paced thriller with characters you actually care about. , ...one heck of a time bending sci fi thriller....... Source Code is a well made sci fi thriller, continuing the evolution of an interesting filmmaker in Duncan Jones."

Except for the ambience the look of the film it stumbles awkwardly on every level..The final verdict on this movie is that for all its attempts to replicate the great movies of the 1940s, it fails miserably..While admirable as an example of directorial innovation and homage, The Good German fails to connect on a basic emotional level..A homage to the romantic noir mysteries of the 1940s, a tribute that tries hard but, alas, misses the mark..Buddies Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney started out so well. But The Good German is so painful that their recent decision to go their separate ways really merits a gospel choir..While the title raises the question of whether it is possible to escape atrocity without somehow being complicit with those committing them ... Soderbergh seems infinitely more interested in making an anachronism than a timeless film."

Martin Sheen is very good in the film. He plays things pretty close to the vest but the voiceover gives us a clear view into his thinking, fears, and insecurities..I see why it is considered one of the great films of the 1970s..Apocalypse Now is the kind of film that makes me thank God I fell in love with cinema..Artistically, its quite reminiscent of film noir, with an abundance of deep shadows, a desolate voiceover by Willard, and a cast of morally unstructured antiheroes. , One of the great films of the arguably greatest decade in American cinema....It was made through a combination of fear and determination, ending with an experience that is frightening, thought provoking, and brilliant..The eerie journey upriver taken by a tormented officer Martin Sheen to kill his rogue superior Marlon Brando remains as trippily compelling as many will recall..One of the pleasures of Apocalypse Now is that Coppola never settles for a single explanation..Apocalypse has the expressive extravagance of a Wagner opera and not merely because the swooping helicopter scene is set to the Ride of the Valkyries..This monumental apocalypse of napalm and helicopters ends up being a total spectacle of war, rarely achieved in film. Full Review in Spanish.Although Apocalypse Now is not a great movie, it shows a still impressive, politically inspired ambition a reminder of why film culture matters... Mixing pessimism with astonishment, it expanded cultural unease on a grand 70mm scale..It has coherence, truthfulness, and conviction up to a point..The film holds together well enough until it reaches its final muddle, and it has scenes and moments unequaled in recent European or American movies..Good or bad, success or failure, this is a magnificent, gonzo piece of cinema, and the art form would be far lesser if it had never existed..An indelible statement on the lunacy of war."

Consider Titans a PG rated, kindhearted drill for the brutal sadism that would win Denzel Washington an Oscar for Training Day..The film is quite lightweight for the subject matter, but Washington and company make it watchable..Maybe its all true.

His every incarnation as Wikus first as a cheerful, if incompetent suit, then as a pathetic xenophobe, to finally a self sacrificing warrior rings true..I wont tell you to rush out and see it, but in these days of sequels and remakes, this was an interesting original. , Neill Blomkamp has made an instant science fiction classic. From beginning to end, the thrills magnify, intensify into a horrific drama that will live for the ages..I dont know guys, at the end of the day its aliens and hard for me to take this seriously. , It is a sign of intelligent filmmaking when those crafting the movie realize that less is more. Real artists show restraint..It has become almost impossible to make a sci fi film these days that doesnt spend its last 30 minutes in a multiple orgasm roar of screaming, shooting and shattering explosions. , The wonder is that despite its obvious roots, District 9 feels staggeringly original..Blomkamp is good at mustering speedy action and posting grisly sight gags in the background, carnage always hovering comically at the edge of your vision.

But more than Maggie, the show actually belongs to the guilt ridden Frankie....Its too bad it is nihilism dressed up as compassion. , ... Clint Eastwood teaches us his journey to achieve respect with modesty. Full Review in Spanish.In Million Dollar Baby, Eastwood makes us believe both that the relationship is completely surprising and wholly a product of fate..Its about so much more than boxing. Its about redemption, risk taking, the search for family and God, the pursuit of a dream, a soul shattering moral dilemma and the father daughter relationship that develops between Frankie and Maggie. , As sappy and Lifetime y as all this sounds, Eastwoods skill with the performers keeps Million Dollar Baby afloat. , What moves you so powerfully at the end is not just a shattering tale of two old guys and a female boxer but, in our new millennium, a 74 year old mans ability to tell it so powerfully without apparently the melancholy business of movies laying a glove , Its very conventionality is what makes it so compelling weve seen this before, but it still gets us every time. , Always one of Americas most undervalued directors, Clint Eastwood is proving himself the American cinemas national treasure in the third act of his career. , A heartfelt, creditable picture..I dont think its his masterpiece, but its a big, beautiful, sad film with unforgettable performances. , Anyone who doesnt believe that Clint Eastwood is one of the best film makers in America ought to see Million Dollar Baby."

Full Review in Spanish , What saves Notebook, or at least lifts it above itself, are the hints of hard won grit that both Gosling and Garner inject into their characters..Sure, The Notebooks story of first love tends toward the histrionic and self important. But if thats case, perhaps Cassavetes, like Shakespeare, simply knows how to give the people what they want. , Its no secret that Mr. Gosling is one of our most gifted young actors. Still, this is his first romantic lead, and hes superb interesting in his inwardness, endearing in his demonstrativeness. , If you ever want to see a flawless example of a movie which is redeemed from mediocrity solely through the cast, there is hardly a better one than this..Bland and sentimental, The Notebook is old fashioned filmmaking aimed at an old fashioned audience.

But Id have preferred it if Singleton had jettisoned the B movie elements and concentrated on the brothers relationships."

It s weird, hilarious, and actually scary The Cabin in the Woods has it all..The cast is far stronger than one usually finds in this type of film..It functions as horror, comedy, and as a deconstructionist essay on genre filmmaking. Remarkably clever, more hilarious than I expected, and gory enough to sate horror fanatics of all varieties,.It features a fantastic cast, a witty and clever script and is very well structured. This film is one of THE best horror movies and should definitely be included in your annual Halloween viewing line up..Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon called the movie something for us. In that sense, The Cabin in the Woods is a gift to horror fans..Disgusting at times and fun in others, The Cabin in the Woods is like a breath of fresh air to an exhausted genre..A ll put together with dry, wry, self deprecating humor that is so clever, witty and entertaining it just knocks the film out of the park, er, woods..Let yourself go and youre in for a thrilling treat that will induce numerous, genuine laughs. , One thing Whedon and writer first time director Drew Goddard are great at is finding and exploiting new talent..For those with a taste for horror, this is a wild, witty ride with a trenchant edge of referential satire..One of the most creative and thoroughly entertaining experiences the horror genre has given us in quite some time..This essentially evolves into an exercise of self awareness, with Wheldon and Goddards script taking some subtle and not so subtle jabs at the slasher genre. It all builds to a final act that is full of laughs, even if they are a bit uncomfortable. , A perfect introduction to the genre thats accessible enough to reel folk in. The rest of us will go giddy counting the references. , There is a great breadth of narrative invention at work here, as well as a lot of thoughtfulness about quite a few subjects. Cabin effectively looks at the horror genre without ever even tapping on, much less breaking, the fourth wall..With a combination of his trademark wit and comedy gore, Whedon has once again reinvigorated a stale genre."

Full review in Spanish , Hanna is a fun and stylish movie as well as a showcase for young Saoirse Ronan..The perfectly engineered soldier theme is nothing new, but Wright is less concerned about that. Hanna is a beautifully crafted, smart, funny film that floats above its genre conventions. , Perhaps Hanna is a good film because the action is part of the narrative rather than the narrative being a part of the action..Even though there are misogynistic undercurrents to the fatal gunshot wound Hanna delivers... Weigler will never die because she lives on in Hanna, and her story will be retold and revised just like the fables women and girls pass on to one another..We walk out of it with more questions than anything else, which can sometimes be a films strength ... but thats not the case here. , Ostensibly a thriller about a teenage assassin, Hanna reveals itself to be a fairytale with a modern twist..A unique, often strange take on both an action film and a growing up story.Explosive, intense, heart pounding, riveting, pulsating...and these are just a few of the adjectives to describe Hanna..The deeper the story gets, the more convoluted and preposterous it becomes. Still, Hanna is a lot of fun, thanks to Ronan and two great action sequences..The thing with Joe Wrights beautifully shot movie is that it never really feels true. , Overall, Saoirse Ronan is a marvelous, powerful actress and Hanna is a great character. Perhaps a sequel to the film Hanna will have a script worthier of both..Hanna is a pulse pounding, lethal fairy tale actioner..The soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers is outstanding. It makes the film look rather like a series of music videos, but so well shot and energetic, the viewer doesnt really mind. , A dark, twisted fairy tale. I just missed your heart, Hanna says to an elk she shoots at the beginning of the film. The film itself, however, is almost right on target."

Almost..Nicholas Stoller has created a refreshing film, which offers a realistic edge in an otherwise clich d genre..This comedy of romantic manners is bloated, soft in the middle and belted with a too skinny storyline, but, hey, its got enough belly laughs to get by and a pair of terrifically engaging lead actors in Jason Segel and Emily Blunt. , A crowd pleasing, smartly drawn, character driven exploration of relationship dynamics with plenty of laughs to keep it going..Segel and Blunt are so talented that its hard not to find a little joy in some moments, but this is a film in serious need of a little editing and one that pales in comparison to Segels and Stollers previous work. , It has emotional heft, with no frantic, last minute drives to the airport, just a male and female lead who not only share actual, proper, bona fide chemistry hallelujah Praise be but are also allowed to go head to head as equals..The Five Year Engagement is sweet without being saccharine and real without being gloomy..There is an extremely satisfying, mature, giddy happy ending, even while future issues remain unresolved..Youd be challenged to laugh once during a two hour plus slog in which much of the intended hilarity resides in frequent utterances of the F bomb, venison and Wham posters. , Its a bit over stuffed, but the narrative does come full circle and successfully balances charming comedy gags grounded in a memorable and contemporary love story. , Youll definitely laugh and its hard to resist the adorableness factor of Blunt and Segel. , The Jason Segel Emily Blunt romcom has a cold, standoffish first act but ultimately warms up, becoming a genuinely sweet romantic comedy."

The movie was released in . 2005 The charactistics of the movie are rape secret minnesota witness miner insult court lawsuit love lesbian battle case woman woman director landmark harrassment legal . 1989. Josey Aimes takes her two kids, Sammy and Karen, and leaves her abusive husband Wayne, to return to her northern Minnesota home town. On a chance meeting with her old friend Glory Dodge who works as a driver and union rep at the mine operated by Pearson Taconite and Steel, Josey decides to work at the mine as well. Working at the mine does not sit well with her father, Hank Aimes, who also works at the mine and who, like the other male workers, believes she is taking a job away from a man. Hank has believed that all Josey's problems are of her own doing, ever since she, unmarried, had Sammy while she was still in high school. Josey has always stated that she does not know who Sammy's biological father is, which fosters Hank's attitude about her. Among Josey's coworkers is Bobby Sharp, who many believe is Sammy's biological father. Josey's evangelical mother, Alice Aimes, stands by her husband in their general belief of traditional roles of men and women. Josey and her fellow female mine workers are continually harassed, emotionally, physically and sexually by their male counterparts. Every seeming step forward in the issue Josey finds is only a measure to lull the women into a false sense of security, or to make the fall even harder. Unable to withstand the abuse, Josey decides to sue the company for sexual harassment. She does so with the help of Glory and her husband Kyle's friend, Bill White, an ex-New York lawyer who is facing his own emotional demons. They being able to get any corroboration is difficult as all Josey's male coworkers are standing together, and all the women fear retribution by the company and/or their male coworkers after the fact.

Unfortunately, that is not so. , Despite a competent performance from Butler, Machine Gun Preacher tackles way too much material to present a cohesive onscreen telling of the Sam Childers story..Its an uncomfortable marriage of sentimental genre conventions and real life tragedy shown with graphic detail.

Gary Grays richly textured direction and a thumping soundtrack that confirms rap as the protest music of its time. , Gray and screenwriters Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff at times feel too handcuffed to the groups well documented history, breaking up the rhythm of the story to check off a minor, well documented detail of the journey. , The dramatic and tense moments are executed extremely well.

But it’s far from humorless and the big action, creepy setting, and snappy pacing keeps things engaging..No matter how much the genre has been beaten to death in the years since its release, Snyders remake is enduringly scary, thrilling, and incurably watchable time after time. It remains his best film. , Dawn of the Dead reflects the bigger budget director George Romero raised after his first hit, with splashier splatter and a screenplay that considers social issues in between all the mayhem..That rare bird, a remake that, while not matching its predecessor, nevertheless succeeds on its own terms..A triumph matched by no other 21st Century horror remake I can name..A rare worthy remake which breathed new life into the then decaying horror genre, it still holds up brilliant today..Zack Snyders debut feature reimagines Romero as a visceral, amped up apocalypse in the shadow of 9 11 , Far and away Snyders best film, the remake deftly pays homage to its predecessor while charting its own path. Scary, with great set pieces and a nihilistic ending, the films only letdown is its zombie baby subplot, which is DOA. , It has something to say about the human person, society and sometimes religion..The film totally sanitizes Romeros use of a shopping mall as a site of consumerist critique. , Entertaining, an easy way to pass an hour and a half, some messed up scenes but Im intrigued to hear that Zack Snyder wants to revisit... , They couldve avoided a few infuriating things, but regardless of all that, very very entertaining. The action, and pacing of the film, very well done. When things ramp up, they ramp up fast, but even in the dull moments, theres something bubbling. , What Gunn and Snyder manage to do, above all else, is make zombies terrifying again..It is ferocious and young and exciting..A memorable film for fans of the genre. Full review in Spanish.a pretty solid horror flick.There are scares aplenty in Dawn of the Dead enjoy them and be well. Twenty years from now, though, I know which version Ill still be watching. , One of the genres best pure zombie fest films featuring regular folks against an army of the undead. , Nicely respectful of the original film, this remake amps up the adrenalin charged action while skimping on the depth to deliver a gripping but empty headed thrill ride."

All of those controversies have some merit. But that doesn’t mean the film itself deserves to be written off. 15th anniversary.Fifteen years after its release, Knocked Up is a time capsule of comedy filmmaking from over a decade ago..Judd Apatows gags are strewn with crude language and extreme behavior but his humor is all grounded in character and relationships and prickly moments of self realization and guilt, and his cast mixes it up wonderfully..Knocked Up crafts pathos and spit takes from the truism that life will invariably make adults of us all whether we like it or not..Knocked Up works thanks in large part to a strong cast and Apatows ability to stretch a seemingly razor thin premise into a well developed OK, maybe too developed final product. , Knocked Up must be the funniest Hollywood romantic comedy since Apatows 40 Year Old Virgin. Granted, there are higher compliments, but the movie undeniably offers audiences many abdomen impairing moments theyll talk and talk and talk about. , Asmart, charming, uproarious, unabashedly filthy sex comedy that delivers on all levels..What makes Knocked Up stand out is not just the fact that the jokes are side splittingly funny but that nearly everything that happens to the couple rings so true..The very fact that some clearly juvenile filmmakers have hit on the truth that a baby in the womb is as much a life as the one cradled in its mothers arms is encouraging. , What really sells it is a fantastic support cast featuring Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill and Leslie Mann..... Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl have great chemistry onscreen and they are hysterical together..It might look slightly risqu but the message remains the same get married, stay married and buy lots of stuff..Apatow makes responsibility and commitment funny no mean feat..What makes most of Knocked Up work is its ability to squeeze big laughs out of real world situations..Knocked Up proves that hit comedy doesnt have to dumb down for its demographic. , With sparkling performances from Rogen and Heigl, Apatow once again shows his sharp eye for talent and continuing knack for hits..The movie is a decisive breakthrough for Apatow, whose comic instincts go hand in hand with an unfashionable empathy..Its a hysterical, well acted, and wonderful glimpse at impending parenthood from a mans perspective..."

Passing himself off as a single father, he starts to meet a string of single mums, confident in his ability to leave them behind when they start to ask for a commitment.

Twelve year old Marcus Brewer lives with his chronically depressed single mother, Fiona Brewer. Both Fiona and Marcus beat to their own respective drummers. Marcus will do whatever he can to make his depressed mother happy, even if it causes himself grief. As such, he realizes that he is perceived as different than most kids, as even the self-professed weird kids don't want to hang out with him as he is the target of bullying. Part of the taunts against him are the fact that he sings and speaks to himself without even realizing that he is doing it. Meanwhile, thirty-eight year old Will Freeman is a slacker who has lived comfortably off the royalties of a song written by his deceased father, and as such has never had to work a day in his life. He is a solitary man who places himself as the first and only priority in life. He comes across the idea that dating single moms meets his selfish carnal needs. It is in this capacity that Will meets Marcus, as one of Will's single mother conquests, Suzie, is friends with the Brewers. Trying to escape his life but wanting Will to date Fiona, Marcus infiltrates Will's life, much to Will's chagrin. Will slowly begins to realize that Marcus is more than just a nuisance, but rather someone who needs some guidance navigating through the trials of adolescence and the trials of dealing with a suicidal mother, and perhaps he can be a small part of providing that direction. Conversely, Marcus may be able to show Will the path to becoming a real adult.",positive,1.0,"The film has tremendous star power, added to this fact, its a remarkably warm and witty film, filmed with unique creativity and visual gusto, and a catchy soundtrack. , The splendid effectiveness of About a Boy lies fully in the precise work of adaptation that the Weitz brothers make of the original text. Full Review in Spanish , In print. Hornbys story was lapped up by women. On screen, it looks likes the worst kind of unconvincing, unfelt schmaltz, and faintly misogynist in the subordination of its female characters to the needs of its male star. Come back, Richard Curtis. , While the movie has some awkwardly executed scenes and slow spots... this is a comedy with a heart... Its funny, its smart, its poignant and its set on Planet Earth. , ...a thoroughly average piece of work....Even people who dont usually like Hugh Grant will be charmed by him in the scrappy, slightly scandalous comedy About a Boy. , The directors Paul and Chris Weitz the American Pie brothers have tried hard not to make a tearjerker, and at its best the movie is knowing and tart..If the story gets dangerously thin, Grant is pretty well flawless. And Collette, always good, is heartbreakingly believable..About a Boy is truly a love story, with dialogue and a story line thats both pop and universally timeless, which is gold for moviegoers. , Genuinely funny and moving, this is both an endearing examination of masculinity and a challenge to male isolationism..Grants puckishness has become overly packaged whats new about him here is his spiky hairdo. This movie is built on an actor as well as a character who is too intent to be on his best behavior. , Mainstream comedies should all be this funny and tender and deftly performed..Grant, seeming to get better the further hes allowed to extend his range, delivers a terrific central performance, as acerbic but more complex than his sexy snake in Bridget Jones. , Hugh Grant hilariously redefines the word playboy in the first half of this film, then gets human, without losing his comic edge, under the influence of the title waif..About a Boy is better than a feelgood movie, its a feelgreat movie genuinely clever, affecting when you least expect it to be and funny from start to finish. , Compared to High Fidelity, the book and the movie, About A Boy seems resolutely uncool.... But part of growing up may be admitting that such familiar comforts can also be immensely satisfying..About a Boy is an amusing film, full of bright lines and clever observation..This charming coming of age comedy, a tale with heart and social message, offers Hugh Grant his best role to date..Thankfully, this film is grounded and has a firm sense of reality and is consequently more affecting for it..Like Billy Wilder with a British bent, About a Boy lithely dances around uneasy comedy attempted suicide, fragile kids of divorce, childhood bereft of memorable experiences. But it never trivializes them, emphasizing life s quality over its quantity."

Don t get me wrong, Express is still good enough that I left entertained just not nearly as much as I hoped I would..This is a baggy, pointless, tiresome film, which is also messy, puerile, cack handedly gruesome and plain unfunny..David Gordon Green seems to have used this template as some sort of experiment... Greens method is like a stone cold killer in a John Woo movie He makes us laugh, then immediately shoots us in the face. , The party got out of hand towards the end, and we probably should have booked out before we got too tired..You would have to smoke a great deal of the stuff to make Pineapple Express seem like a good movie, although from the assorted giggles at the Rio Theatre, the audience was ripped and receptive..Your love of it will largely depend on how funny you find a movie with 85 percent of the jokes based on smoking weed. For the rest of you a lot of it is going to feel very silly, crammed with potty humor and overly long for such a simple subject matter..Given that cast, crew and audience were and will be baked throughout, Pineapple Express just about earns itself a pass..This is possibly the first time a blackened, burnt corpse is played for laughs.

Gran Torino contains within its strangely tight wanderings the utter, dexterous precision of drama comedy and tragedy given not to intellect and consideration, but to profound conviction and feeling..Seeing Eastwood ward off young gangsters was odd... well, but he pulled it off enough..Covers a lot of ground as it rolls religion, the toll of war, mortality, what it means to be a man..Twenty minutes in, we know Walt is eventually going to give the car to the kid.

Important themes one and all, but theyre wrapped in a movie that does not do them justice. , To my own surprise I ended up enjoying this movie more than I anticipated I would after the first few minutes in..The cast is truly the thing in Phillip Noyces adaptation of Lois Lowrys YA novel The Giver. , Noyces cinematography is striking, shifting from dullish gray to the full spectrum of the rainbow, but the movies plot and final denouement are telegraphed from virtually its first nanosecond. , Bland and flavorless..For a film that claims to champion colorful nonconformity, The Giver is depressingly drab..The powerful allegory that initially made Lowrys text such a lasting achievement seems cheapened by the glossy, over baked screen version that seems more medicated than the anesthetized minds of its characters. , This could have been an actual young adult film, letting preteens know that the conflicting waves of emotion they re about to receive are worth it. Instead, it s a movie where a holographic cameo by Taylor Swift isn t the worst part..Although the film has a few merits, including the deft use of a colour motif that harks back to Oz, a dull and predictable ending does nothing to help it overall the studio clearly has its fingers crossed for yet another series..Read the book instead..Yet in its execution, the whole lacks the courage of its convictions with no sign of the drama necessary to make it as thought provoking it pretends to be..But with 94 minutes of running time, it would have benefited from additional scenes... instead of an extensive introduction narrative and rushing through the third act with action towards a rather abrupt ending..The bottom line is that if you focus on its message, The Giver has some very important things to say. You just might find yourself a little frustrated with the information you get or rather, dont get along the way. , Despite the impressive cast Taylor Swift has a cameo , performances are uneven..The performances by all the characters are adequate, but the story had a friend and me riveted to the screen. But then, we like movies that are actually about something."

Full review in Spanish.Essentially an extended music video, and with about as much narrative weight, August Rush is empty, flat, and pointless..A music box trying to pass itself off as an orchestra..The only thing astounding about this movie is how bad it is..Someone in Hollywood must have it in for Thanksgiving. How else to explain the cruelly timed release of August Rush, a wretched confection that only the most determined will be able to count among their blessings.While many films require a suspension of disbelief, August Rush asks viewers to terminate their disbelief without severance and have security escort it from the building..August Rush kind of feels like a 2 hour coming attractions preview. Lots of fragmented stuff happens, without ever connecting the dots in between..It doesnt matter if you love music or inspirational stories or Robin Williams anyone this is enough to make your teeth ache. , More fable than film, there is no earthly reason why August Rush should work.

But whether its message is accurately targeted is for the viewer to decide.The reason Stop Loss works, unlike its 2007 predecessors, is that it cares more about its characters than it does about making a political point..Though it is very message oriented and a little sloppy at times, I found the subject to be really interesting and the opening war scene will blow you away..An honest vocalization of the inchoate discomfort so many Americans on either side of the political divide are feeling..But whatever you think about the Iraq war and the people who are fighting in it, youll be shaken up and moved by Stop Loss. , Distancing Stop Loss from other Iraq films by highlighting an American military tactic that has been little talked about, Peirce has crafted a credible but hardly outstanding effort that may disappoint those expecting another Boys Dont Cry. , Stop Loss takes some time out from the argument over the validity of the war to ask a question closer to home whether the emotional battlefield America subjects its young soldiers to is actually worth it."

Its time to get possessed with The Possession. , A hollow shell of a possession flick, one that kills 90 minutes successfully but doesnt do anything more. , Derivative, predictable and unforgivably mediocre..Familiar tropes require something original in execution for interest arousal, and The Possession simply does not deliver the goods..Its a shame that the film couldnt have been possessed by the spirit of Sam Raimi. Or even Ted Raimi, for that matter. , By objectifying Jews as exotic others rather than presenting them as subjects, the Raimi production eliminates the precise element that would have been most powerful for a Jewish audience."

But, mostly it s a retread of spooky films that went before..The movie is well appointed if not terribly well thought out..Isabelle Adjani and Sam Neill give mesmerizingly out there performances as a troubled couple trying to hold it together for their young son..While frustratingly vague in terms of character and motivation, The Possession is among the more competent of recent studio horror efforts. If only that wasnt the best thing I could say about it. , When it comes to exorcism movies, the Catholics have the Jews beat.Disquieting, lush in style, and most importantly, emotionally engaging, The Possession is a throwback to celebrated cinematic horror of old..In lesser hands, The Possession would simply feel like a blatant rip off from horror days of yore. Yet Bornedals well crafted feature proves far better than expected. , The Possession fails to differentiate itself from standard exorcism stories and movie experiences even if it is Based on True Events."

As a woman utterly convinced of her own superiority and righteousness, Foster gives us a very welcome reminder of her talent and her fearlessness. , It plays like Edward Albee s classic Who s Afraid of Virginia Woolf rewritten by the staff of Frasier into something a little less threatening."

And there is perhaps a bit too much New Yorker style, upper middle self satisfaction in that rather thin insight..As painful as it was for the two couples in this story to meet and spend, it seems, 80 minutes together, it was even more brutal for the audience..Roman Polanski, adapting a play by Yasmina Reza into a Brooklyn kammerspiel, turns Bu uel s The Exterminating Angel into a non fantastic comedic farce of banal bourgeois pettiness..I doubt whether anyone will recognize elements of themselves within these characters, and without that, one cant identify enough with any of the protagonists to bring about the kind of discomfort that comes with the self recognition of human failing. , Carnage is just another in a long line of improbable movie depictions of New York as seen in Sex and the City and other such drivel."

Because those are not just steps..Stallone manages to reproduce the lovable character with a recognizable charm and personality..Stallone and his character are well past their primes, but instead of making the film totally preposterous, the film embraces that fact and uses it to create a movie that really captures the spirit of the first two films..The premise of Rocky Balboa is pretty preposterous, yet somehow it manages to work because Stallone imbues the proceedings with such heart and pathos..The thing about Rocky Balboa is that it had no business being as good as it was..The problems facing Rocky are the same as those that Sylvestor Stallone must deal with a once great career, a slide into obscurity and a return to the scene of your greatest achievement to relight a flame. That Stallone succeeds is down to a script.....a strong capper to an admittedly uneven series....A compelling and emotionally touching film that reminds of the first two Rocky movies, Rocky Balboa is an excellent finale which shows just how good an actor Sylvester Stallone is when given the right material..Stallone wrote and directed this cinematic ride down memory lane that puts a final grace note on his indelible creation..Its no knockout, but it does go a solid, nostalgic 15 rounds. , In the obligatory boxing terms, Balboa will K.O. your expectations, but that may only be because theyre rightfully below the belt to begin with and because this sixth installment is coming after the bell has already rung. , I know, I know, youre thinking, oh please, not Rocky again.

Spike Jonze delivers a profound exploration on the evolution of love and oneself. Full review in Spanish.Maybe love can take many forms. And maybe tech can ultimately just be a tool when put into perspective maybe it can help us positively evolve as humans. Exploring our still in progress relationship with it at least makes for one helluva film....With Her, Jonze also proves himself to be a very acute observer of the hypersensitive generation that was raised on the computer..Anyway, if Jonzes concern is presumably with humanitys future and fate, Samantha is largely a diversion, a gimmick. , An oddball story, but its not an oddball film. It is ripe with real human emotion and commentary on a generations reliance on technology at the cost of social interaction. , Spike Jonze has a brilliant eye for style and inventiveness, taking on a conventional quasi futuristic narrative and giving it a heart and a philosophical message..Tender, soulful, and thought provoking, Spike Jonzes film uses its bizarre sci fi scenario to both comment on the modern reliance on technology as well as impart wisdom about the state of human relationships. , I wasnt blown away by Her. I was enveloped by it. , A sweet, delicate story, that can be emotionally pummeling while never losing its fundamental optimism..An unconventional way of telling an age old story that works so well that you forget about its unconventionality as its humanity washes over you..It is a romantic drama bordering on the eccentric and is not afraid to show the psychological depth of human relationships. Full review in Spanish....the film excels in its terrific execution and intriguing framework and despite the technological trappings and high concept, HER is filled with humanity..Her has the most richly genuine denouement, a sincere sense of awakening where a stunted character recognizes his potential..Overall, Her is a beautiful film wonderful acting, great story and dreamy soundtrack. Miss it and youll miss out. , Her wasnt as fantastically profound emotionally as the similarly toned Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It lopes a bit in the middle when you want it to run."

The role, that is. The tacky shirt stays on pretty well the whole time. , 1408 is another Stephen King adaptation where the main protagonist is a writer. It is also a fine psychological horror movie and welcome change of pace from the ultra violent, gore polluted, torture porn flicks currently infecting cinema..A good, old fashioned horror flick, one that relies on supernatural chills, psychological twists and top shelf special effects as opposed to the recent trend toward ball gags, bound wrists and bad lighting..Cusacks gritty, near over the top performance goes a long way, as does the subtle slow burn from director Mikael H fstr m, but Samuel L. Jackson needed to be nudged awake as the hotel manager. , Forcing the audience to experience his terror with an almost first hand immediacy, Cusack runs the emotional gamut ....From the start, it builds to a point of unbearable tension and then rewards us with a payoff that is cleverly executed and genuinely terrifying..Cusack always manages to underscore panic with irony..Im very hard to please when it comes to the horror genre, but pleased I am with 1408, a dread concoction from Stephen King, sharply committed to film by a clever screenplay, solid direction and terrific performances."

Full review in Spanish.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy tells a challenging tale. Emotionally distant, winding in on itself over and over again. I find it to be brilliant if cold..Inherently a tale of intrigue, Alfredson may have created one of the most introverted spy thrillers ever filmed..Those with a refined palate for challenging, intelligent and charismatic storytelling should unashamedly gorge themselves on the feast presented here..A strikingly crafted homage to a bygone era of filmmaking that also feels thrillingly contemporary..Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is everything that one feels it should be. It is complex, intelligent, quiet, intense and keeps its cool throughout..Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a welcome throwback to old time espionage stories..So beautifully executed and so visually absorbing and so atmospherically hypnotic that I wonder this would it have been awfully greedy to have hoped to have wholly understood it, too.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a wonderfully stylised piece that accepts the importance of visual aesthetics without losing any substance in terms of plot or narrative action..It starts slow, and a bit confusing for those not familiar with the novels, but builds to intensity, creating a taut, sinister spy story for grown ups."

I want people to do better. , This was a bad movie..You know a movie is bad when its supposed to be a comedy but its first dozen or so jokes leave the audience in deathly silence. , If you want to watch a good time movie and to have a giggle without having to think, Bad Moms will do the trick..There are some good gags and the female leads are engaging, but it could have been a whole lot more. Watch it with your expectations as low as if your kids were invited to a playdate at my house..Theres probably more scenes in slow motion in Bad Moms than in The Matrix. , Bad Moms is a film that isn t really written with moms in mind and takes the easy way out with a lot of the issues it attempts to tackle, even humorously."

It probably doesnt help that, as a spoof on the Twilight franchise, its making fun of movies I also dont enjoy. , Its almost as cynical as the actual Twilight, and not nearly as funny. , It is as monotonous and predictable as rain in November..All but the most die hard fans can agree that the Twilight movies are spoof worthy. So its too bad they dont get a worthy spoof. , An insult to other bad vampire movies, which is saying a mouthful..There are few things worse than watching a comedy flatline for over an hour, tossing its funny parts into a vacuum of uncomfortable silence..A banal mess that sacrifices anything resembling satire for a series of smutty jokes..Only Friedberg and Seltzer could film this dross with the belief they are making even a half decent comedy..Casting two lookalikes and coaching your young actors to mimic the trio from Twilight isnt enough to make for a great parody. , There was a time when, for a certain generation, the release of a new Naked Gun or Hot Shots movie would be cause for real excitement..A movie that will have you pining to watch the real Twilight films. Yes, its that bad. , A witless, puerile spoof of the Twilight movies..Vampires Suck misses its targets in spectacular fashion thanks to the directors usual approach of simply recreating scenes from the original movies without any real understanding of what to satirise or even how to go about it."

He runs for office with lover Scott Smith as his campaign manager. Victory finally comes on the same day Dan White wins in the city's conservative district.

A film for our time. A film that is timely. A film not to be missed. , Milk is very much an accessible journey driven by a remarkably charismatic performance from Sean Penn..Sean Penn is remarkable as Milk, giving what could very well be the finest performance in his distinguished career..The film has a talented cast, some sharp direction and a story that is as relevant today as it was when it unfolded in the late 70s. , Penn is so well tuned that not for a minute does his Milk lapse into a caricature..Gus Van Sants portrait of San Francisco politician Harvey Milk clunks along as the squarest movie hes ever made, a result of the director investing more emotion in the martyred idol than in the bleeding man. , Like many a nostalgia trip, it stops at the moment the style its rejecting is about to begin. , Sean Penns portrayal of Milk stands out, with his considerable weight loss and authentic body language... Full review in Spanish , Milk is fortuitously, if inevitably, a movie of its moment..Penn may be the main attraction, but this is very much an ensemble piece. Emile Hirsch, as cheeky street kid turned activist Cleve Jones, Diego Luna as Milks annoyingly needy, unstable second lover and James Francos Scott, add to the communal spirit. , Dustin Lance Blacks attempts to dress up this schema in the gay trappings afforded by his subject do nothing to meaningfully pervert the form or Milks emotional tidiness. , Penns performance is inspiring, a transformation that finds the heart and soul of a historical figure and sends blood pumping through a man who has become practically deified over the decades. , While making a political, historical biopic, Van Sant managed, concurrently, to make a visually beautiful, emotionally thrilling and surprisingly personal work of art..Penn burrows inside his character, capturing not only Milks Long Island Jewish intonations and his gay body language but also the intensity of his beliefs and the particular mix of fear and desire through which he viewed the world. , Harvey repeats throughout the film, you ve gotta give em hope. He did the legwork. The film is just a reminder."

Full review in Spanish.Penn and Hirsch test our patience with a time tripping style of cinema that mixes fiction and nonfiction narrative styles, physical and emotional nudity, facial hair and hard to watch hunting scenes..Into the Wild captures the recklessness, the passion, and also the cruelty of youth..This is a film that is full of life, showing how much living the young man did in his short time on earth, yet its laced with the tragic realization that his life was somewhat wasted. , A masterpiece a rapturous, quintessential American odyssey that earns its place in the pantheon of the great road films and at the pinnacle of this year s very best..Penns direction intuitively acts as a spiritual proxy for McCandless own rapturous way that he processes his journey. , Sean Penns adaptation of Jon Krakauers non fiction book is a bracing cinematic plunge into the odyssey of Christopher McCandless. ,.Every once in awhile, a movie will come outta nowhere and blow your socks off..Crafting his meditation on the men who answer the call of the wild, Sean Penns adaptation is heavy on mood and ambiance but sadly lacking in depth, giving up on the wider comparisons to focus fully on McCandless, who may not be up to the scrutiny. , Its a bit heavy handed, but ultimately a rewarding watch. , Even in its harrowing final moments, it reaches a spiritually transcendent pinnacle the idea of ending one long, strange trip and plummeting into an even greater unknown with both fear and elation. A stirring American drama of comfort and conflict..An uplifting and enriching cautionary tale about one mans spiritual adventure on the road and in the wilderness. , Even Penns more indulgent flourishes seem to enhance the films keen feeling. , Penns film displays a deep and abiding love for America, set against a critique of the uglier aspects that exist alongside all that the beauty. , The kind of insipid hero worship that traps the subject in wax.Thank goodness for Eric Gautier’s miracle of cinematography that floods the screen with spectacular moments of pristine beauty and long shots ....A long trip, but worth the wait.

Audiences are left wondering when the freshman cast is going to learn the rudiments of performing..A dumb, dumb film, to be sure, but also undeniably funny in more spots than a right thinking, mature adult person feels comfortable admitting..A woman a few rows in front of me at the preview chose to write 20 minutes worth of text messages, rather than watch the movie. Even though she was not paying, the price was clearly too high..If Judd Apatow is the Jesus of modern comedy, Seltzer and Friedberg are the Anti Christ and sadly just as prolific"

Given the cast attached to it, you will expect more especially as theres so much to focus on which results in a few outstanding plot holes. , This is a nasty bit of pulp noir that knows what it is and makes no attempt to be otherwise..Director John Hillcoat has done a good job weaving this together. Its not that hard to follow and the characters are pretty well developed. Hard to watch Yes. Its long at over 2 hours. But stick with it. Its worth staying for the smart payoff. , Director John Hillcoat is a master of the visceral, slightly depressing mood, so its a surprise that hes whipped a completely different rabbit out of the hat with Triple 9. , Triple 9 features a strong cast, which is why it s a bit disappointing that the film ultimately dries up, instead of firing on all cylinders..Triple 9 does bring a couple of new ideas to the table and, though nothing it does is particularly groundbreaking, it is an entertaining ride whilst it lasts."

Joaquin Phoenix is enormous in this ode to seventies Los Angeles. Full review in Spanish , No one word that can encompass all of LA, but with Inherent Vice, Anderson adds a couple of crucial sentences to its definition. , Inherent Vice is crazy good, an adrenalized road trip journey into the guts of 70s LA. Joaquin Phoenixs Oscar shot, and Paul Thomas Anderson continues his winning ways. Far out. , As Sportello, Phoenix is deliciously off kilter, stumbling through a city thats lit in shades of neon by cinematographer Robert Elswit... , Inherent Vice is a tough nut to crack. Its as if, in striving to navigate the tonal intricacies of Pynchons style, Anderson misses the joy of his best work. , The filmmaker s banal concentration on the love story goes hand in hand with the decision to give Inherent Vice as a whole a drug induced feeling, as though the camera and the pacing were under the influence..This is a Paul Thomas Anderson film and, yeah, hes done it again. , Inherent Vice is a movie best lived as an experience. Sit back and let Anderson take you on a ride hazy ride, accept it like a cloud of smoke blown into your face, and feel what comes..The plot might be a bit all over the place and hard to follow at times, but if you just sit back and let the movie take control, Inherent Vice turns out to be a fun ride..Im firmly on the side of loving it, but I know its not for everybody.

And after all, this isnt about angels, its about windshield wipers. , Nothing too special here..Following a twelve year patent dispute regarding the invention of the intermittent windshield wiper motor, its not as interesting as it sounds. , A thoughtful inquiry into the doubtful benefits of pursuing ones ideals to the end of the line, as they say in Double Indemnity. , On its simplified terms of one man against the machine, the movie works, thanks almost entirely to Greg Kinnears performance. , Seriously undermined by the skeletal script, which barely develops the characters and unintentionally raises more questions about Kearnss quixotic battle than it answers. , You may find yourself staring at your windshield wipers in fascination after you see Flash of Genius, whichi s based on the real life story of a little guy who went up against a corporation..Too much technical information about circuit boards, Motorola transistors and U.S. patent laws eventually takes up more screen time than Kearns sympathetic story, leaving the viewer restless and bored."

For all its comedy, Back to the Future is about a kid coming to terms with his parents inadequacies, a moment familiar to everyone, and the fulcrum in growing up. , This fusion of sci fi, action, romance and comedy could have been a dreadful mess, were it not for writer director Robert Zemeckis and co writer Bob Gales refusal to let a loose line or idea escape their pens. , The humour, the pathos, the tension even the blooming soundtrack all conspire to ensure that the tale of a teenager traveling back 30 years to ensure his parents meet and ultimately mate can, given its vintage, now be fairly described as a classic..Under the splendid direction of Robert Zemeckis, who also co authored the screenplay with Bob Gale, Back to the Future is a joyous flight into the domain of a teen ager s fantasy."

To describe the film in a word, its quite simply, magnificent. , As it is, The Book Thief still finds its way into your heart slowly and over time, and it stays there way after leaving the theater..It may span the most significant decades of last century, but The Book Thief pretty much boils down to girl lives with family, girl learns to read for two hours..Its probably a little too modest for its potential Oscar goals, but its a fine film nonetheless. , The Book Thief manages to capture the horror of war and the tension of life in the Hubermann household, and there are moments that will shock those not familiar with the story."

And the crises keep piling up in Matt's life. His best buddy Barry has just gotten fired from his job, his brainy sister Wendy is getting hitched to her vapid boyfriend Kyle, and the gorgeous Tori Frederking, long-time object of Matt's unattainable adoration, is suddenly back in the picture.

But the flat direction becomes wearisome and the story runs out of steam before it even reaches a romcom ending that is more sentimental than subversive..The Invention of Lying, which Gervais wrote, directed, and stars in, is only a comedy for about 20 minutes. The rest is an atheistic treatise mocking anyone who believes there is a God and that He imposed a moral order on the world..Not funny or surreal enough to distract you from its shortcomings and not subversive enough, if at all, to actually have something to say..Somewhere between a great concept and an awful script The Invention of Lying got lost in its own truth gimmick. But the truth is, it starts bad and just gets worse..I kid you not when I say I sat there wondering is there nothing more to this film Am I overlooking something I dont think so, and I couldnt wait for the lights to go up. , Light and disposable entertainment to be sure, but that trademark dry Gervais wit keeps the proceedings engaging enough..As mildly amusing as it can be in places, it still wont convince non fans that Gervais can play anything other than the fool. ,.Gervais satiric barbs on religion, beauty, disillusionment and the basic human need for hope aim for our comfort zones, and they all hit home. , The premise is clever but the film is not bold enough.While there is nothing wrong with a comedy engaging in religious satire, neither Gervais nor Robinson seems willing to take on the topic thoughtfully..A high concept, laugh free over indulgence that blows up terribly in the face of its smug star..Gervaiss attempts at ridiculing faith through satire only ends up becoming an offensive caricature backed with atheistic egotism. , Theres clear comic potential in the films high concept, and a fair amount of it is realized. , A wry case for atheism, The Invention of Lying would have sent many Americans into an uproar if anyone had bothered to see it."

Miles is something of a sad sack, a high school English teacher who is a failed writer at heart. He has yet to get over the fact that his wife has divorced him and that she has remarried and he now faces that nerve racking wait for word from a prospective publisher. Miles has an opportunity to start anew when he meets Stephanie's friend Maya but when he let's slip that Jack is about to be married any hope of a relationship seems to be lost.",positive,1.0,"Payne is a compassionate observer here, letting the dialogue scenes breathe, unafraid to throw in some slapstick..It is a powerfully written story captured onscreen by Alexander Payne with a wondrous humanity and sensitivity..This is a film about human beings who can be flawed and prickly but if you go a little deeper, you will see beauty. This is a wonderfully written script, with a great performance by Paul Giamatti..Funny, touching, and features perhaps the best ensemble work of any film in recent memory. And like fine wine, the movie ages well upon reflection..A film that not only demands to be sampled but to be gulped down and savored like the vintage draft that it is..Unfolding at a relaxed tempo, and unobtrusively edited, Sideways is a welcome throwback to 1970s Bob Rafelson and Jerry Schatzberg..Where Paynes fondness for template narratives has started to become a problem, Sideways as the title evinces has much a more complex take on the possibility of catharsis , A beautiful little chamber dramedy about four sharply drawn characters played with a very lovely mixture of nuance and showmanship..Paynes most enjoyable movie since Election ,.Payne does know how to capture two kinds of male menopause. But I cant say he ever surprised me. , Excellent but explicit movie is not for kids..Sideways is about wine aged to perfection sipped by men who ve aged to mediocrity softer, hornier versions of Walter and The Dude. But Miles s brutal honesty is its soul. He s annoyingly, depressingly out there, but never fraudulent..Giamatti handily raises what couldve been a pedestrian road trip romance into the stratosphere of a world class character study , A very memorable slice of life..This wonderfully satisfying study in human nature is funny and sad and profoundly entertaining from start to finish..Sideways stays resolutely life size. And that, in this age of hype and hyperventilation, may be the most radical thing about it..Sideways is the first of Paynes films in which we have the chance to really care for the characters he reins in his harsh satire better than before. , No one does quivering on the edge of depression quite like Paul Giamatti..This ones like to appeal greatly to the 30 40 somethings that are getting more and more into bourgeois sports such as yachting, polo or wine tasting."

Everything is laughably bad, everything. But somewhere along the line, I found myself emotionally invested in this syrupy nonsense on the screen. , It really isnt quite that awful. Its just beastly. , Aimed squarely at Twilights teenage fans, this is about as subtle as a baseball bat to the head and only marginally more enjoyable. , Beastly isnt good but its not nearly as awful as I expected. , So this isnt a great re imagining of the classic fairy tale Beauty and the Beast, but Beastly does have mass tweener appeal. , Under rated..... tone deaf do students today really say hurl chunks and Too cool for school , predictably plotted, filled with drippy love songs that would embarrass Bryan Ferry..Some snappy pacing and hints of pain throbbing beneath the cool sarcasm of teens push much of Beastly past its skin deep pandering to a teen demographic. Still, this 21st century fairy tale doesnt wilt, but its not quite refreshed, either. , Its basically programming a generation of young girls to yield to the will of a patriarchal society and grow up to become biddable Stepford Wives. This evil must be stopped. , Beauty And The Beast except with the lusty, gothic menace that makes that story interesting replaced by moany teenagers and crap acoustic guitar music. Or, in short, Dawsons Freak. , Undermines its central message about substance over style by sacrificing characterisation for glossy visuals..Beastly doesnt quite cover it. Not even monstrous, gruesome or grotesque come close. , Its not nearly as bad as youve probably heard, thanks to a mercifully short running time and decent performances throughout, but a sloppy script denies Beastly the hormone infused gravitas it desperately needs."

Full Review in Spanish.On the strength of their 2003 slasher flick, High Tension, Craven hired director writer Alexandre Aja and writer Gr gory Levasseur, and the result is one of the most exhilarating, intense, and engrossing Hollywood shockers ever made..Still not a perfect film, but its still superior to the original. , Of considerably richer interest than the revampings of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Fog, not the least for having American heartland horrors viewed through foreign glasses.The resulting bloodbath, both nasty and hilarious, is a master class in the art of the remake, wavering somewhere between respectful reimagining and gleeful pastiche..Like Cravens original, Ajas version gets the job done it makes your stomach turn, puts you on edge, and gives you a horror movie ride. , The film is intelligent and aware, if utterly gross, and on a technical level its first rate. , full review in Greek.It was going to take a lot to sell me on the remake.

Ajas effort is an absolute declaration of war. , Falls into the trap of delivering its relentless arsenal of painful images with almost sedated enthusiasm. The movie has no venom..It is an artfully crafted exercise in high octane style, bolstered by a stronger cast than most horror films could ever hope to assemble, but its a bitter, sleazy little pill that leaves an ugly aftertaste. , Some say this remake is better than the original, but it aint so. , Its self conscious nastiness, once removed from its motivating source. , ... a scary, if none too original, horror movie. Unrated.These Hills might have eyes, but they could have used some brains, or at least a steadier hand and a less contemptible sensibility to guide the grisly proceedings..The Hills Have Eyes involves one basic premise freaks with very rusty weapons eviscerating, disemboweling and decapitating stupid travelers lost somewhere between Point A and B ....To describe this film as pornographically violent is an affront to pornography."

She was nominated for a Tony Award at the age of 12..Both acerbic and friendly in a way that gives it bite without giving it too much edge..Singing during the dialogue helps..A slovenly lark, but a spirited one..Luckily, Pitch Perfect has just enough flaws to almost keep us from making terrible puns around its title, but this fun comedy is good enough to leave an a cappella version of No Diggity stuck in your head. For a week..Very funny at times, usually when it embraces the campiness of the subject matter."

Its more like a Syfy Channel show where they try to scare people in a darkened room. , A thinly sketched paranormal thriller stripped almost bare of anything that might provide some color, complication or personality..The Apparition is a rare example of filmmaking failure that is so complete, it will exacerbate its audience in nearly every way possible..Every fo paux The Apparition commits stems from a general atmosphere lacking any vibrant heartbeat, creating characters and conflicts which are tragically birthed on life support..This horror movie from Warner Bros. is nothing special, but its nice to see a modest genre entertainment buoyed by a major studios resources. , When you look into this abyss, it yawns back at you..Plants wither and furniture is rearranged, as if the demon were an inconsiderate housesitter..The whole ordeal only lasts 82 minutes, but thats still too long for a film with no ambition aside from lightening your wallet."

After his death sometime in his 43rd year, suburbanite Lester Burnham tells of the last few weeks of his life, during which he had no idea of his imminent passing. He is a husband to real estate agent Carolyn Burnham and father to high school student Jane Burnham. Although Lester and Carolyn once loved each other, they now merely tolerate each other. Typical wallflower Jane also hates both her parents; the three suffer individually in silence in their home life. Jane tries to steer clear of both her parents. Carolyn, relatively new to the real estate business, wants to create the persona of success to further her career, aspiring to the professional life of Buddy Kane, the king of the real estate business in their neighborhood. Lester merely walks mindlessly through life, including at his job in advertising. His company is downsizing, and he, like all the other employees, has to justify his position to the newly hired efficiency expert to keep his job. Things change for Lester when he falls in love at first sight with Jane's more experienced classmate, Angela Hayes. Both Janie and Angela can see Lester's sexual infatuation with Angela, who courts such attention from any man as a sign that she is model material, she having once appeared in Seventeen and is a career to which she aspires. Lester's infatuation with Angela gives him a reenergized view on life, where he openly doesn't care anymore what anyone thinks about what he does, anyone except Angela. This infatuation coincides with the Fittses moving in next door: homophobic disciplinarian US Marine Colonel Frank Fitts who rules the house with a military fist (that fist being both figurative and literal), his semi-comatose wife Barbara Fitts, and their bright and quietly subversive 18-year-old son Ricky Fitts, who openly abides by his father's rules while behind the scenes lives by his own quite different perspective. Much like Lester's infatuation, Ricky immediately becomes infatuated with Jane; he considers girls like Angela as ordinary.

But ultimately once it ends you may feel youve seen better movies. , The curious thing about The Imitation Game, without falling into bombast, is that it breaks codes with the wonderful performance of Benedict Cumberbatch. Full review in Spanish.One of the films achievements comes from hinting at the enormous power possessed by an unseen monarch... , Benedict Cumberbatch...Mark Strong and Matthew Goode... each delivers enigmatic performances that challenge the audience to think and look below the surface for the truth of each real life character portrayed..Though hindsight is always 20 20, The Imitation Game gives us a fair and balanced glance at the tragedies that prejudice and inequality can cause. Turing achieved more in one war torn decade than Bill Gates or Steve Jobs..It is watchable and entertaining but more importantly its a movie that reveals to the world a man whos achievements many more should celebrate. , Cumberbatch conveys tortured humanity behind the analytical fa ade, even if we also understand and even chuckle at how frustrating Turing could be to those working with him..Gorgeously realised, engagingly witty and with great performances all around, The Imitation Game is engrossing and accomplished..Keira Knightley is cut glass and surprisingly convincing as Joan Clark..Cumberbatch is great as Turing."

Our hero gets more than he bargained for when he meets the man who is married to the woman he loves.",positive,1.0,"Drive is rife with moments like these, some which use the very real frustrations of a people as a catalyst for action and others which are just pop culture references that people within that community will recognize immediately..With Drive, Steve Wang tackled a classic American genre in the buddy action picture, but infused it with Hong Kong style martial arts and gun battles that are just about unrivaled in terms of US made action films."

Its ambition proves to be its strength, giving filmgoers looking for something a little more quiet and reflective a satisfying excursion..Its possible to admire lots of things about The Place Beyond The Pines but still feel like the movie stumbles on its own ambition. , Cianfrance, aided by cinematographer Sean Bobbitt, peaks far too early this time round, offering up a sweeping three parter that only ever sweeps when in the company of its resident James Dean, before stuttering to a crawl. , The structure is certainly brave and director Derek Cianfrance...has a gift for naturalism. Naturalism, however, isnt the same thing as realism, and the more the filmmakers insist on their theme, the harder it is to buy into it. , Nevertheless, Cianfrances Pines is thoughtful, transfixing and a solid study on the skepticism of reinventing ourselves regardless for whatever price we must pay for our indelible fate to be unleashed."

The combination of art and science, technology and emotion, separates U23D from being just a nifty 3D experiment and elevates it to a pop mast.U2 3D is the perfect synergy of music, technology and magic..Represents what is far and away the most impressive use of 3 D Ive ever seen. , You, too, can be there..The rock mega band U2 has made so many concert films that its hard to get excited about this one.... But the film is a revelation, redefining 3D live action moviemaking. , U2 is a great band, but 3 D doesnt make them greater. , Inadvertently, U2 3D mimics perfectly the empty, intimacy free spectacle that is stadium rock..It makes you want to climb on screen and give the big, eco friendly lug a hug."

As the gung ho Nam veteran, Goodmans tenacious, tightly coiled demeanor is smartly explosive and very funny. , What made Fargo work, aside from the regional kitsch, was a solid story and believable characters worth caring about. The Big Lebowski has neither..The Big Lebowski 1998 is a dark, idiosyncratic and quirky comedy crime caper thriller involving an intriguing complex case of mistaken identity, deception, double crosses, and a mysterious kidnapping. It came from the inventive, cultish....The Big Lebowski is easy to love and rewarding to obsess over, but for me, it s more than just a fun movie to quote it s a comforting memory generator, and when I watch it, if I squint, I can kind of see my dad again..Lebowskis virtuosity serves a sense of modesty. , One of a kind..If one were to examine the entire cinematic resume of the Coen Brothers, The Big Lebowskiwould assuredly rest within the top five spots..Ill just say this The Big Lebowksi is an excellent movie and damn funny. , A return to form... where large men scream very loudly and jokes are pounded into the ground with vigor and brio. Goodmans Walter is a bullet headed, barely contained titan of rage, running on the fumes of cracked beliefs and fierce garble gabble."

But I think Ill wait for the console to play it on. , Centurion offers a somewhat believable theory as to what happened to the 9th Legion, or if not believable, then at least entertaining..Quickly establishes itself as refreshingly superior to the standard, run of the mill swords and sandals epic..Centurion follows the Roman armys infamous Ninth Legion as it moves forward from Hadrians wall into Scotland to destroy the Picts, a violent and barbarous race that plagued the Romans throughout their time in Britain. , Its clear almost immediately that Centurions biggest assets are its various performances and visceral, violent sensibilities... , ... an entertaining film, for adults who are not intimidated by rivers of blood. Full review in Spanish.Centruion is an exciting and intense action adventure film with fantastic fight scenes and strong acting..A darned entertaining outing from a director who knows action and doesnt share Hollywoods fear of period pieces that dont involve Greek gods. , Michael Fassbender can carry a movie..With a raucous, gruesome tone, this Roman era British action movie takes us back in time in such a vivid way that we often feel a bit queasy while watching. If the story were stronger, wed be glued to the screen. , The sight of a technologically superior occupying force coming a cropper in hostile foreign territory inescapably brings modern Afghanistan to mind..Auteur cinema of a very narrow stripe, this personalizes a familiar genre to advance a singularly pessimistic view of humanity..Director Neil Marshall thrills yet again setting forth his own vision of the gladiator epic that pays tribute to the classic tropes of the sub genre, but is concurrently a revenge film and journey in to darkness....Features a commitment to craft that helps overcome issues of storytelling by providing a visceral, violent experience designed to get you in your gut and bones more than in your heart or head..Its a cat and mouse game where we are stuck rooting for the cat even though it killed and raped thousands of mice. , If I believed in the concept of guilty pleasures, I d classify Centurion as one, but I think I maybe just kind of enjoyed it."

It succeeds, somewhat, but boringly, which leaves the truth not served well. , The end credits songs beautifully delivered, full throttle emotional bombast only serves as a dismaying reminder of how much the film otherwise lacks any similar passion and soul. , The audacity and determination of its subject doesnt find its way into this shallow and superficial biopic. , This biopic is part hagiography, part expose, and gravely incoherent..Though Winnie Mandela is a more than serviceable classroom recounting of events, it fails to reach much higher than that, and deals with identity issues when deciding whether to challenge your views or simply glorify real life events..Sometimes it can be strangely said that its a miracle when a certain film even exists, warts and all. So lets cut to the chase, and what really matters in this immensely important movie. Not the least which is, Strike a woman, and you strike a rock. , A warts and all biopic which focuses on its subjects childhood, college days and marriage while making short shrift of her transition into a war criminal. , The films tonal inconsistencies speak less to the struggles of its titular subject than to its own grasp exceeding ambitions. , It would have benefited the film if Roodt had been as bold with the mechanics of his storytelling as he is with his inclusion of the title characters less savory moments. But its strengths, particularly the two lead performances, far outweigh its flaws. , Biopic is well acted but uneven and violent..Winnie is no masterpiece, but not nearly as bad as the early reviews. , Winnie Mandela really stumbles when it comes to depicting the couple s painful separation, which the film suggests resulted more from politics than Winnie s infidelity..Distant and obvious, it takes a story with many angles and reduces its edges, becoming a glorified TV movie..Ms. Hudsons frequent and distracting costume changes are a sign of deeper problems in a movie that wants to be all things to all people, especially women."

Full review in Spanish , Abi Morgans bold script has Meryl Streeps Lady Margaret Thatcher hearing voices and experiencing a full bodied apparition of her late hubby Dennis. This darkly clever film is about class warfare... , And yet, there is poignancy in Lloyds method too, and a defiance of the usual dramatic build of most bio pictures where it is always onward and upward. , ... Meryl Streep adds a richness to the character that is more telling than what is scripted in dialogue..Too much gorging on its female protagonists poignant late failures of the flesh rather than showing what made her such a colossus in the first place. , Make no mistake, this is Streeps show from the first frame to the last. She commands the film with a power and a grace that is as rare as it is breathtaking. , As a portrait of a once powerful woman coping with loss of her faculties, it is sensitive, it is subtle, it is acute. As a portrait of one of the primary leaders of a Western government, it feels partisan...and nonspecific, which is unfortunate..Streep, a prominent presence throughout, truly carries the film..The Iron Lady is a better performance than it is film, although I suspect the performance will carry the day..The Iron Lady is a tremendously good movie in what it includes, but one that is sadly incomplete..Played by the always exceptional Meryl Streep, Thatcher is given more humanity than she may actually deserve."

This film is a slap in every one of their santimonious, ignorant faces..Brokeback Mountain serves as something of an antidote to the incessant homophobic harping....It is challenging to find a movie that grabs you as hard as this does. The story lingers long after its woeful end, ultimately showing the power of such an amazing film, while also keeping and transferring the theme of longing to its audience..Heath Ledger gives an Oscar worthy take on a man who already seems in mourning for a loss he will be late to grasp..Ledger hits all the right notes as Ennis, delivering a quiet performance filled with heartache and sorrow..The passion created here...makes no restrictions on who can understand and appreciate it. This is as fine a love story as there is. May 10, 2018.Lee has crafted a film that flouts stereotypes and becomes one of the most sincere, most deeply felt love stories in years..What is remarkable about the film is how it doesnt politicise the homosexuality theme, transcends it to become the story of two people in doomed love. The two lead characters are wonderfully delineated. , The real achievement of Brokeback Mountain is not that it tells a universal love story that happens to have gay characters in it, but that it tells a distinctively gay story that happens to be so well told that any feeling person can be moved by it..An important and original romance that really and finally portrays the homosexual romance as two humans falling in love and never plays it for clich s....Brokeback Mountain is in no rush. Its emotional impact builds slowly, its rhythms in tune with the countryside the rugged grandeur of the mountains the arid, bleak vistas of backwater Western towns..A romantic western with a twist, Brokeback Mountain is a haunting and well acted exploration of a forbidden and secretive love affair between two cowboys..Brokeback Mountain is ultimately about the paralysis of regret and how it fractures the lives of not just those afflicted by it, but everyone else around them..Lee cant tell the difference between criticizing oppression and turning out an oppressed work , Arguably Ang Lees best film, this swooning, achingly sad near masterpiece offers a universal love story that lingers long in the mind. , If you have the patience to sit through a slow moving romance and you lack the vanity to be put off by explicit cowboy on cowboy relations, youll greatly appreciate the light at the end of Brokeback Mountain, a work of art thats more than just a movie. , At times feels as ancient and familiar as any well worn piece of American legend, even if its content could set John Wayne spinning in his grave..At its core, Brokeback Mountain is not a gay love story u2013it is simply a love story."

It is effortlessly brilliant and always accessible but more important, it slavishly satisfies the first rule of comedy make em laugh. , A less successful picture, mostly because its more concerned with its winking meta textual framework than the larger humanistic concerns of his other work. , Violence may be served up in copious amounts, but McDonagh also creates characters who have no qualms going gently into that good night."

Its hook could easily wear thin if it extended itself too far, but the compact 80 minute running time keeps the tension high and the story moving forward..The Shallows may contain a few occasional shocks, but this is indeed surface level stuff..Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the sunlight following whats proving to be a rather desultory summer movie season, along comes The Shallows to drive everyone back into the deep end of the auditorium. , Audiences hungry for shark inspired terror should find enough of interest despite disturbingly inept human characterizations, but something like Spielbergs original Jaws blows this B movie out of the water. , The Shallows is solid, B movie entertainment. Its the kind of movie you would have expected to see on a drive in double bill back in the 1970s with, say, the original Piranha. , I admit that I have been pleasantly surprised with this movie, The Shallows, especially since for being the typical shark movie it knows when to entertain with the right amount of suspense. Full review in Spanish.It is a Sports Illustrated photo shoot with a shark..It is Blue Crush meets Jaws..The Shallows is a well made summer treat. It has plentiful suspense, just enough gore, and a main character thats as tough as a coral reef. The film does what it needs to do, and it does it swiftly and brutally. , A bit too shallow in the grand scheme of filmmaking and the shark genre, The Shallows is nevertheless fun popcorn fare..A simple enough idea to work, yet too simple enough to be entirely memorable, The Shallows still made for a pretty good watch..The Shallows makes the most of its familiar premise to deliver a thrilling and tense tale of survival grounded by a great lead performance by Blake Lively..Nevertheless, Lively is really good, the ocean looks gorgeous and the survival scenes... were gripping..The Shallows isnt terrible or excruciating. In fact, its an unexpectedly solid piece of entertainment. , The Shallows is a thrilling survival ride..THE SHALLOWS finds its way to being a clever, tension filled chompfest that functions as its own unique experience..The Shallows isnt quite at Jaws status, but it is a refreshingly well done and exciting shark flick in a sea of low budget drivel. I can honestly say that it is the best shark horror film I have seen in at least the last decade. , As shark vs. human movies go, this one is periodically absurd, but generally entertaining..The bulk of the film stays focused on its classic Guy Girl In A Jam premise, and oh, does Lively deliver..Kudos must go, too, to Lively The Town, TVs Gossip Girl , who gives her character true grit, all the while toning down the more obvious ploys of the director."

Its still very good, but a few missteps keep it from ever being more than that. , The black and white versions stark contrasts give greater claustrophobic force to the fragility of civilization when ideology grows as deadly as any marauding beasts.

Lovecrafts Cthulhu mythos has long been one of Kings guiding influences, and Frank Darabonts adaptation of The Mist honors that relationship while also working as a 21st century political parable. , The last 30 minutes play like a dismissive ambush, leading to a final scene so utterly misguided that I wanted to hurl obscenities at the screen..Frank Darabont presents a movie with one of the most pesimist and hopeless endings in cinema history.

Theres plenty of twists and turns in this sensational isolated quest for survival. , The premise alternates between engaging and nonsensical..Taut and oh so thrilling..Unconcerned with the how or why of the scenario, Garland glides us straight into a lithe and increasingly intense narrative centered on the concept of manufactured manipulation..Vikanders turn as Ava is as chilling as it is empathetic, internalising the torment of being considered inferior and subhuman to her male oglers. , Ex Machina takes a familiar concept but presents it in a deep, complex and imaginative way that not only makes it one of the best films to come out of 2015 but certainly in time will rank as one of the best sci fi films ever made..Ex Machina is a smart, well crafted film that will get under your skin and have you questioning the true meaning of being human..At best, it feels more like a calling card or extended short film, but there is enough singularity here to mark Alex Garland out as a writer director of promise..This is a smart, thoughtful, and thrilling science fiction drama..The three leads are equally effective at conveying the ethical perils posed by a future that could be closer than we are prepared to admit."

In 20 years Letters from Iwo Jima will be a classic. , War is hell, always has been, and movies will continue to confirm it for anyone who might doubt.

Im not entirely sure why I could not buy into the film. , Much as already been made about the pride and honor of the Japanese, but as a people they have rarely, if ever, been depicted as fully human characters in American war movies. Its amazing to think what Clint Eastwood has done here. , ... Eastwood takes this film out of the realm of a typical war picture to illuminate the boundless nature of the human spirit, which extends far beyond race and nationality..In Letters, the glossy romanticism of history crumbles before our very eyes..Eastwood has made a film that is thoughtful, poignant, touching, and philosophical. It stands as one of the best works in his long, illustrious career..A Japanese war flick comprised of contrasting character portraits of soldiers torn between dying with honor and the very human instinct of self preservation."

Luckily, this was not the case for the 2012 adaptation....The films biggest achievement is how beautifully it captures the rich tapestry of teenage experiences soaked in lessons learned for a lifetime..How warmly rewarding it is to watch people seem to actually like each other once in awhile.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the best coming of age films ever made, from its strong performances...to its eloquent but grounded screenplay..The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a delicate film which captures the pain, fragility, love and joy of being young like few before it have..Celebrates the stories that make up our lives and the friends and loved ones who help us survive the journey..Stephen Chbosky s decision to translate his MTV cult novel into a movie where the gay kid is the coolest kid pays huge dividends....Chboskys film captures many of the feelings that can engulf the adolescent mind. , Filmed on location in Pittsburg, the setting is the 90s but the script is timeless. Some scenes are as visually compelling as the characters..A pleasant enough evocation of the first stirrings of confidence and maturity in a painfully shy teenager..The Perks of Being a Wallflower is essentially a love letter for the awkward kids, but a film I think everyone can relate to..Its a rare movie that improves upon the book in every way. , The film, much like its reclusive protagonist, manages to carve out its own identity amongst a sea of vapid imitators..A surprisingly spot on directorial debut, cementing Chboskys voice as one to be listened to. His directorial style compliments the material to a tee, and helps to deliver a film thats as earnest, heartfelt and charming as coming of age dramas get. , Perks hits on a kind of universal nostalgia for the teenage years...without blunting the sharp, dark edges it simultaneously imparts..In spite of its downer of an opening act, the film achieves instant lift off the very moment Charlie falls in with the out crowd."

The pacing is spot on, it is tense as hell, you can feel the energy on screen, and though it isnt an overtly political story, there is an underlying social commentary found in the best science fiction. , Attack The Block is my favorite film of 2011..Im glad that science fiction continues to nip at our sense of social consciousness with remarkable storytelling. , Part of what separates Attack the Block from its Spielbergian inspirations... is the sort of reflection on social and racial issues typically left out of popcorn fare..Stands on its own two feet amongst the usual Brit comedy suspects, which is largely due to its cast of unknowns..Attack the Block is one of the funniest films of the year, an even bigger achievement when you realize that almost all the young actors in it are making their feature debuts..For a movie filled with funny moments and low budget, puppetish aliens, the film packs a lot of insight into its premise..Independent cinema with a retro touch.

Angelina Jolie is showing this could be and still is happening in other parts of the world..Overall, Jolie has nothing to be embarrassed about and much of which to be proud with this movie. Even in moments where the film doesnt quite work, she shows ample evidence of ambition and a discerning directors eye. , A brilliant debut written and directed by Jolie. She has an artists eye, strong personal vision, and a masterful command of her stars. , Jolie, however, shows great promise as a visual storyteller, even though this love story is stretched too thinly..T hough it is written and directed by actress Angelina Jolie... there is nothing Hollywood about this film it stars local actors and is in the local languages, and it shies not one whit from the horrors of the war. , Never less than competent, its clearly the result of a sincere, long harboured desire to raise awareness of these horrific, dehumanising events. , Jolies grasp of the material is confident enough to mean that her film never slows down, or loses its way. , This is an often impressive first feature and clearly a sincere and hard hitting exposure of a terrible time..The films key twist seems a bit underdeveloped, but theres no avoiding the horror the film captures. Even in modern times, what monsters men can be. , Its a tough, clear eyed look at a ghastly ethnic war, with an admirably wide perspective that affords compassion for both sides."

Full review in Spanish , Jaws remains a classic not just for how it changed the film industry, but because it is an exquisitely made monster movie that tapped into universal human fears and did so with iconic style..It can be appreciated entirely for its extraordinary entertainment value, nail biting suspense, sense of adventure, and old fashioned Hitchcockian scare tactics..Even decades after its blockbuster release, Jaws is still horrifying, as well as terrifyingly prescient about the current public health and safety crisis..Here is the moment that would forever change how movies are made, marketed, and watched..The beauty of Steven Spielbergs 1975 classic is that you can choose how to watch it as a summery, shark bitten thriller or as an allegory about the failed leadership of institutions... , ...more interesting is where the political and personal intersect... which fits nicely with what the movie as a whole does so well, mixing the horror and adventure with the personal..Jaws was just the beginning of an ever amazing career for Spielberg and has left audiences with a number of quotable lines including the very popular, You re going to need a bigger boat ..Master filmmaker Steven Spielberg doesnt show much of the most famous shark of all time, but you can always sense hes never far away. , It is not only the most realistically terrifying film Ive ever gasped through, it is extraordinarily well made. , Sure, the shark looks a tad mechanical. But the films still a masterpiece of suspenseful story telling, aided by John Williams brilliant score, ground out on a tuba."

Full Review in Spanish.The chase sequences with government agents are tame but the film builds to a tense and witty conclusion at the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker in Colorado Springs..What keeps it remarkably fresh is an unpatronising approach to what is ostensibly a kids thriller, and a set of ideas remember when Hollywood used them that rightly consign all the cradle modems and dot matrix printers to the margins. , This inventive nail biter is very much a product of its time blending the arms race unease of the early 1980s with the beginning of the home computer revolution but it still manages to both grip and entertain..Its far too simplistic for comfort and downright dangerous if it makes anyone think todays self destructive forces will bow jovially out of sight as soon as we grown ups loosen up a little. , Classic humanist didactic filmmaking, effectively presented as a thriller..Memory makes the heart grow fonder, even when youre blowing up the world. , As a Cold War message movie and cinematic descendent of Fail Safe, WarGames examines the inherent danger in favoring technologys cool logic and situational calculations. , In many ways, John Badhams intriguing tale was prophetic. , Suspenseful Cold War tale with teen gamer in control..Although today it feels rather dated, especially with its technology, it is one of the better examples of the genre..In this sage satire, warfare is boiled down to the inanities of tic tac toe.To me, the most enjoyable aspect of WarGames is when David is at work on his computer system. Theres something wonderfully nostalgic about watching a guy play with such antiquated machinery and recognize that it was once considered state of the art. , John Badham solders the pieces into a terrifically exciting story charged by an irresistible idea an extra smart kid can get the world into a whole lot of trouble that it also takes the same extra smart kid to rescue it from..What works best about it works still its a paranoid film with an ambiguous ending. , As tense and effective now as it was 25 years ago.

Although director Wolfgang Petersen emphasizes the claustrophobia of undersea life, his above surface scenes are powerful as well..Effective as an anti war movie and as thrilling as any disaster flick, Das Boot is a humanistic masterpiece..Massively compelling..For all its intensity and excitement and fighting and destruction is, perhaps more than any other film, an anti war film..Das Boot comes across as cold and distant, but the work of Wolfgang Petersen is nevertheless rigorous and skillful, the actors are effective, and the camerawork is risky. Full Review in Spanish.Peterson has captured the teamwork, the claustrophobia and the peril of underwater warfare. He draws compelling performances from the crewmen, many of them quite young..Wolfgang Petersens exceptional anti war, war film is a long haul but never boring as the captain, officers and crew face terror, ennui, excitement and occasional joy in the North Atlantic in 1941. Directors Cut , Das Boot is a psychological thriller of the first order. The fact that the setting is a war is, amazingly and interestingly, only incidental to its points..Everything described in the film is authentic..The execution is second to none taut, claustrophobic and overwhelming..Few war films are more potent than Das Boot...the ultimate submarine movie. Blu ray.It is unlike any other war film in that it confines the audience in a confined submarine where we digest the fear and panic of the human beings on screen. In short, Das Boot is a religious experience..Agripping, impressively detailed account of one harrowing voyage by a German U boat during World War II..Just as good, some say better, than the original classic..Petersens shooting style displays a breathtaking, if impersonal and faintly academic, virtuosity comparable to that of Lean or Coppola."

There is a great film waiting to be made about psychiatry, anti depressants and our youth, but this isnt it. , Mostly this was a quirky, smart, inspiring, and surprisingly enjoyable High School movie..Robert Downey Jr. playing an alcoholic principal lecturing on the dangers of drugs is one of those wonderfully ironic, Twilight Zone moments that only Hollywood can provide..Charlie Bartlett is the Ferris Bueller of our drug addled age. Except hes not a fraction of the charmer ol Ferris was. , The movie is extremely hilarious, yet very serious and emotional at the same time..Hugely entertaining high school drama with a delightfully offbeat script and terrific performances from a superb cast..There are plenty of good qualities in Charlie it just needed to apply itself a little more..F eels like little more than an amalgam of great moments from the John Hughes oeuvre as well as from Thumbsucker, Pump Up the Volume and Over the Edge, among others."

Beautifully directed by veteran Carroll Ballard, Duma fell flat in the United States because of bad timing and abysmal marketing. , A handcrafted masterpiece..Its as good as this sort of thing gets, and deserves to be seen in a proper auditorium rather than on DVD. , The film opens with some adorable cheetah cubs, so youre instantly hooked, but theres more to this than just a bunch of cute animals. , For those wishing they still made films like The Black Stallion, today is your lucky day..Visually panoramic, a film that revels in making the expanse of a beautiful place palpable..Too suspenseful for the youngest children, but for anyone older than 8 or 9, it evokes nothing less than awe at the harsh beauty of the natural world..... a beautifully photographed journey that will thrill youngsters and strongly engage adults..With ravenous alligators and lions on the prowl, Duma delivers familiar adventure, but Ballard refuses to cater to cuteness..Like its title character, Duma has been left to fend for itself by Warner Bros., which is barely releasing it. A successful showing this weekend will prove that there really is an audience for this brand of thoughtful, literate family film..... leads us on a journey sometimes humorous, sometimes harrowing, always heartfelt thats well worth taking. , Director Carroll Ballard makes only one type of movie family adventures that feature some sort of wildlife. To his credit, however, he does them pretty well..Director Carroll Ballard ... not only captures stellar images of nature, but feels the call of the wild in his bones..Chances are excellent that Carroll Ballards latest film Duma isnt playing in a theater anywhere near you. Thats a shame. Its one of those rare childrens films that actually succeeds in delighting tots and their parents. , Exciting but never violent, deeply emotional but never saccharine, Duma is the sort of solid family film Hollywood is always being criticized for not making any more..An old fashion adventure yarn and an absolutely delightful throwback.Family films can be simplistic or condescending, but the joy of Carroll Ballards work is that its neither."

The film is at its very best when the Russells camera is trained upon his hyperactive, ego centric muse. , The Fighter is, if not a champion film for all time, a very good, poignant, and commendable expression of its era postindustrial working class urban America, bereft of history as it is bereft of jobs, strong unions, pride in ones work. , Theres something powerful and real about The Fighter. , Overall The Fighter is a touching, soulful knockout of a movie..The Fighter feels like its barreling toward full on Greek tragedy, and it has its painful patches, but ultimately forgive me the film pulls a lot of punches."

Life is about to get complicated.",positive,1.0,"While the story is sweet and alluring and the film looks fantastic, this is mainly a sparkling showcase for Saoirse Ronan..This is classical filmmaking at its finest, transporting the audience to another time and place to flawlessly recreate the emotional context of Irish immigrants in this setting..Ronan beautifully captures everything Eilis is feeling and thinking and truly brings the audience into Eilis struggle and confusion. Brooklyn is well deserving of the Oscar nomination for Best Picture and Ronan for Best Actress. , Brooklyn is a forthright, approachable, and esteemed historical drama where the dignity and honesty soar to heavenly heights to shine on the plights of love and independence..Overall, however, Brooklyn is a pleasant film, but not an especially compelling one..A movie about decisions that makes all the right decisions..While there are no explosions and no real antagonist, its one of those movies that goes straight to the heart of what it means to be human. , To match the tonal invariability is the perfectly cast Ronan, who is naturally pleasant, seemingly without trying..Screenwriter Nick Hornby An Education and director John Crowley Closed Circuit also do a terrific job of building the dramatic tension between Eiliss old and new lives. , Brooklyn transcend s the banality of a happy ending for something murkier and more beautiful..Saoirse Ronans stellar acting will transport you to the 50s and will make you fall in love with this beautiful love story.

Its all rather lovely, if completely unchallenging. , I was surprised at how enjoyable and skillfully made Brooklyn is I cried when everyone else did and gasped when the rest of the audience did too, but in spite of its excellent art direction and affecting performances the film is mostly hokum..Its a lovely piece of cinema, and one of the best movies of 2015 to date."

It is a pity the film does as little as it does to present or convey them..Woman in Gold is just but one story in the ongoing battle for the return of stolen artwork during the Holocaust..Woman in Golds balancing act between sweet and saccharine is a fight to the end, with Mirren ensuring the former, and the film is only just the victor. , I feel terrible about what happened to Altmann and her family but this movie isnt the tribute they deserved. , A merely adequate tale of identity and family and the American Dream. Its a sad Hollywood tradition to take amazing, bizarre true stories, sterilize them, prune them, buff them, and smoosh them into a uniform, textureless box. , May not quite reach gold level cinematic status, but its a firm silver medal finisher, thanks to the cast and the very intriguing story. , If theres a weak link, it is the script, which drifts toward tedious at times something hard to imagine with this story. In the end, the performances and the subject create an inspirational film. , A courtroom drama proves to be a stately change of pace for Reynolds.....it doesnt take any risks and it doesnt try to surprise its audience, which makes it feel more like a well made TV production than a theatrical movie. Full review in Spanish , The film comes and goes with flashbacks to show the horror of the occupation... Full review in Spanish.Helen Mirren is flawless, in turns feisty and dignified, and she elevates mediocre, paint by numbers biopic material into something moderately engaging..Woman in Gold is a David and Goliath story..Mirren makes us believe this is a fresh, just discovered Third Reich atrocity. Shes that present, that charismatic, that vulnerable. , Mirren and Reynolds play off each other nicely..With Gold, Curtis does justice to a fascinating story with far reaching political and cultural implications. He helms with a sensitive hand, while maintaining a healthy pace."

Not to mention a magical performance by Robin Williams..While Damon and Affleck clearly feel at home with each other in familiar surroundings during Good Will Hunting, their story relies on heart more than location since caring and friendship taking precedence..Good Will Hunting still holds up as a great film..What Matt Damon and Ben Affleck accomplish with such a profound, witty, inspirational and heartbreaking script is quite extraordinary. And then, Mr. Robin Williams takes it to another level. Full review in Spanish.The acting is outstanding Williams and Damon perfectly embody their roles, creating a believable, poignant, powerful partnership full of uplifting, feel good triumphs..On the surface there doesnt seem to be too much going on, but dig a little deeper and youll find remarkably telling insights into the mind games that go with being a genius. , The film offers Robin Williams the chance to show his dramatic acting skills..Good Will Hunting is lyrically directed, efficiently written, side splittingly funny, quietly devastating..The movie... is surprisingly moving, though resolutely unsentimental, rites of passage yarn..Its a deceptively good performance by Williams the schmaltzy raw materials of Maguire would seem to be a trap, but he plays it absolutely straight, in muted, dignified tones , The headline story from this slice of honestly earned sentiment is Matt Damon, who delivers the years No. 1 breakthrough performance directly atop his agreeable high profile turn in John Grishams The Rainmaker. , It s a movie that captures in a way that perhaps an older screenwriter could not convey the limitless possibilities of youth, a movie in which a character can tell another, without cynicism, You could do anything you want. You are bound by nothing..The best thing about Good Will Hunting is not in its well crafted, psychological symmetries but in the just plain messiness of its humanity. Its rowdy, its funny, its heartbreaking it rings of life. , A crowd pleaser, with bags of charm to spare..Most movies about troubled individuals are insulting in the way in which they suddenly wrap things up with insipid developments that cause tumultuous, positive transformations in the protagonist this film avoids that pitfall..Towering performance by Matt Damon as a troubled working class who needs to address his creative genius elevates this drama way above its therapeutic approach, resulting in a zeitgeist film that may touch chord with young viewers the way The Graduate did.Despite its coarse exterior, Good Will Hunting proves to be a rather positive and motivational experience..The film works as a character driven narrative because Mr. Van Sant and his co screenwriters are not afraid to unlock the psychological mysteries of their five major characters with clear and concise dialogue..Can get overly sentimental at times, but Gus Van Sants sensitive direction... and his excellent use of the city make it a hugely entertaining and effective film."

You can commend a sequel for trying to build on and expand the original, but this film seems to have regressed..In a film where ghostly children attempt to force other kids to watch horror movies only to be repeatedly told I don t want to , this somehow manages to be a microcosm for Sinister 2. I don t want to watch any more either..Sinister 2 depends greatly on cheap scares..A lackluster follow up to what was a fairly unimpressive horror entry..Whilst Sinister 2 at least manages to avoid being a mere re tread, the final product comes off as decidedly flat."

Full review in Spanish , Giving her best performance in quite some time, Anne Heche is simply magnificent..This is a well made, imperfect kind of movie, containing a lot of laughs and heart despite its weaknesses..Cedar Rapids gains points for mixing up its very, very rude comedy with a real sense of purpose..A slightly uneven comedy with enough laughs to overcome the lulls..Isnt a blazingly original comedy, but it has such a nice, tender hearted feel to it I was won over and charmed. , Ed Helms delivers some dialed down, hilarious moments that never feel like second rate gags..a fun little movie that really strikes a balance between comfortable friendliness and crazy silliness.The risks Cedar Rapids takes may not always pay off, but as a general rule, I would advise spending 86 minutes of your life with the movie rather than the city itself..While this isnt destined to be remembered as a great standout comedy ... it is still guaranteed to provide a few giggles and knee slaps. , With Cedar Rapids, the filmmakers seem to put too much faith in their material, thinking that it would be funny enough to carry the whole film without them having to put too much thought into the story. Sadly, they were quite mistaken..Youve already heard what Cedar Rapids has to say, but the ensemble cast does a good job of going over the same ground so that you dont mind covering it with them. , The cast is inherently likable, and the comedy is pleasantly sweet natured even if crack pipes, c bombs and references to The Wire abound ..... I wanted to spend more time with these characters ....Theres a restraint and sweetness to the raunch that keeps it below the threshold of certain other R rated comedies about away from home shenanigans gone bawdily awry. , The supporting cast are uniformly excellent too, particular Reilly, whose blow hard Deanzie gradually reveals a softer, empathetic side..Hopelessly benign but still boisterous enough to deliver a mild buzz..Everyone does good work here, but for Helms this is a breakout role, and he delivers. Cedar Rapids is a modest but disarming comedy that will leave a smile on your face..."

Youll like everyone in this movie, and youll leave the theater thinking they would probably like you too. ,.The messages about silver linings in lousy jobs, the collision of hormones and heartstrings, and the adventure of discovering who you really are and what you really want ring honest and true, for any era..Adventureland is ultimately an interesting but flawed mixture of Mottollas early indie sensibility The Daytrippers with some of the more mainstream teen comedy elements of Superbad. , Adventurelands young cast is strong, and, when the film works, it captures the languid limbo of post adolescent confusion and longing. , A coming of age tale based loosely on the experiences of writer director Greg Mottola, Adventureland is a surprisingly dense teen flick yet its unfortunate forays into religion bashing undermines its overall effect..Its a bit slight and rambling, but also manages to engage us due to the sharply drawn characters , Mottola has done his job in making the work feel authentic, funny, and like a breeze to sit through."

Full review in Spanish , With scintillating wit and endlessly quotable dialogue, Easy A is a potent critique of retrograde attitudes towards female sexuality..Like most other teen comedies before it, it may be a complete flight of fancy when compared to the real American high school experience, but nevertheless its smart, funny and totally endearing. , This was nothing but fun times for me..This is a smart and funny film that works largely due to Stone... giving a performance that is full of sass and spunk, but also sweet and kind of vulnerable..Hollywood is going gaga for Emma Stone at the moment, and on the strength of her performance in this hit American teen comedy, its easy to see why. , An extremely easy film to lose yourself in, as well as being one of those rare teen comedies that has an actual heart to it..It was funny. Like really funny, with genuine laughter, not those half laugh, half huff things that so many comedies settle for. In key moments, Easy A went for the gut buster..This film is just pure escapism and doesnt even hint at any practical solution to the widespread problem of bullying among youths. , WIll Gluck captures todays high school soul with the same resourcefulness as John Hughes did in Ferris Beullers Day Off. Its not quite as endearing, but its a helluva good start. , Easy A transcends the mold of teenage cautionary tales while still providing some serious laughs and genuine moments. It has a wildly fresh script that keeps you laughing throughout and Emma Stone is great in the lead role..What we get is a surprisingly funny film that has some charm to it, which is not something you hear applied to comedies all that often..This is the film where Stone really established herself not only as a star but as an engaging and charismatic actress"

Full review in Spanish , The Secret of Kells is an independent animated film that, in my opinion, has an imaginative visual style, as well as allusions to Irish mythology, but its narrative is as soft as the sheets of a century old manuscript. Full review in Spanish , Its skillful balancing act of paganism and Christianity in its evocation of medieval Celtic spirituality is both fascinating and enchanting..The rich colors, lavish designs and charming characters are capable of captivating even the most avid fans of computer animation..Kells has a decidedly pleasing to the eye, retro cartoon vibe ... an intriguing and rare artistic subgenre.Very few animated films have had such a mesmerizing, puzzle like quality..This is perhaps the most enchanting and zealous animated endeavor you will see this side of the Pixar lineup.....theres never a point at which the viewer is wholeheartedly drawn into the admittedly simple narrative. , A unique film visually, but the story and characters are a bit weak and the pacing is a bit slow..Steeped in both magic and mythology, The Secret Of Kells offers a refreshing alternative to Hollywood fare..Combining a classic fairytale trajectory with a singular aesthetic that fuses Celtic and Christian mythology, this stunning film is yet another example of the rude health of contemporary animation..Tomm Moores Irish animation, drawn with painstaking reference to both Celtic myth and medieval manuscripts, possesses a lively originality that shows Europes animators not far behind Americas and in some ways in front of them. , This understated Irish charmer deserves to reach a wider audience, if only to remind people that animation is a diverse medium that can be exploited in numerous ways to tell all sorts of stories..Hand drawn and watercoloured, the animation is as sublime as a stained glass window..The look of the film is simply ravishing..A low key pleasure..A feast for the eyes that manages to be both whimsical and sinister..While this is a handsome picture that laudably avoids patronising its audience, its not always as child friendly as it might be. , Unlike anything else youve seen, and very much worth seeking out, this is a unique and beautiful creation. , The story is a bit tangled, and there is too much of it packed into nearly 80 minutes, but little kids wont be bothered when the animation is so magical."

In the town of Willard, the Robinsons - father Bill (Dylan Baker), mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), and adolescent son Timmy (Kesun Loder) - are one family who don't own a zombie as a domestic, since Bill is afraid of zombies, as, when he was a child, he had to shoot his own zombie father, who tried to eat him.

This it does, just barely..If not better than the French original, this re make is equally good and equally funny..Bill Nighy nabs most of the laughs with his suave, sarcastic, sophisticated character..With an interesting premise and a capable cast, its a shame the result is such a dead horse. , In Anglicising director Pierre Salvadoris 1993 French original, Lynn and screenwriter Lucinda Coxon have created a rich, colourful and intricately mannered comedy, brought to life with wonderfully wry performances across the board."

For two hours, the film takes us into a completely disrupted world in which destruction and ambivalence are omnipresent. A film you will never forget..The opening motorbike chase is still thrilling, but the dedication to the backgrounds as well as crowds of people filling the screen, explosions happening in the distance, and a jaw dropping sense of scope make Akira the classic that it is..Akiras strangeness is very startling and sometimes bewildering. But there is a thanatonic rapture to its vision of a whole world ending and being reborn as something else. , Ive seen the movie four times, and this go around my jaw was lower on the floor than ever before, somehow. , Its dark and violent but, because it is so creative, it is a really fun experience. Its like Inception but way more trippy , It continues to show the best of the genre, almost 30 years later. It would be sacrilegious to give a different rating from PERFECT to AKIRA. Full review in Spanish.Handsome and preposterously ambitious, and even its worst narrative missteps are a factor of that ambition..Akira is a blast and a half, a twisted dystopian parable of violence and rock and roll, Japanese style. Its Disney on PCP, mean, rotten, psychotic, but incredibly vivid. , Extremely violent classic introduced anime to Westerners..Moments that can only be captured as animation make Akira still worth watching gusts of wind from chopper blades, ka tooming bursts of fiery explosions, Tetsuos visions. , Plenty of superb recent blockbusters, including The Matrix, The Dark Knight, Minority Report, Dark City and Inception, are all in its debt not to mention a fair number of shockers, like Star Wars Episode II and the most recent Resident Evil atrocity..Put it up there with the most astonishing animated features ever made..Style and substance run neck and neck in this thrilling, bold landmark film that just refuses to become dated..The cityscapes are awesome, the camerawork is dizzying. If youre new to manga, prepare to be converted. , Akira is pure concentrated cinematic excellence accept no substitutes..When you absolutely, positively have to get some anime in your life, accept no substitutes 23 years on, Akira is still the genres crowning achievement."

Go straight to the head of the class with AN EDUCATION.This is a charming coming of age film anchored by a star making turn from lead Carey Mulligan..Its Lone Scherfigs subtle direction and Mr. Hornbys thoughtful script that make An Education such an interesting film, though. , Scherfig manages this relationship superbly and its this central lesson that makes An Education a film that will delight both the young and old. , This is a nostalgically elegant, comically restrained, cleverly scripted film which, in parts, is also extremely moving..One of the chief pleasures of Lone Scherfigs crisply confident and charmingly comic coming of age drama is in seeing a teenage girl kick against the pricks for a change. , An Education is so good, so intelligent that it invites little shocks of recognition or inspires debate..This is a lovely, delicious film with fine acting and a unique plot..Whats good about Mulligans performance is that its subtle, and seemingly very natural.

Full review in Spanish.As the pinched, ever wary, heartbreaking Nobbs, Close gives a tricky, high wire, award worthy performance yet she commendably resists any temptation to be showy, campy or spectacular in the least..Theres no contrived moralizing bridge to modern relevance, no overt nod to contemporary gender politics and no real reason why Close shouldnt get some respect this awards season. , Close, in one of her greatest performances, is quiet, still, almost invisible to those around her. Its not a stunt or an impersonation, its a perfect realization of what someone in her position might endure just to eat. , Closes performance is no less sensational than Heath Ledgers as the close mouthed Ennis in Brokeback Mountain. , Ones admiration for Closes work becomes more for her versatility and fearlessness than a connection with the character she portrays. , Glenn Close does her best Clay Aiken impression as she pretends to be a male butler in 19th century Ireland..Glenn Closes character couldnt be more buttoned up, but beneath the reserve she conveys a lifetime of loneliness, hurt and quiet heartache. , ...Academy Award nominated performances might be reason enough to see Albert Nobbs"

Full review in Spanish.The cinematography is so seductive, so sensual, that when paired with Cliff Martinezs pulsating score, The Neon Demon becomes something impulsively alluring even if it leaves one feeling rather icky. , Its an examination of superficiality, although one without a desired layer of actual subtext, attempting to terrorize with instances of Grand Guignol, which often feels adolescent when such shock values fail to seem perverse. , Theres something pernicious in a world that places such a high premium on how a woman looks, but little of that feels explored.

You have to enjoy it for its aesthetics and mood. Let it wash over you and you will be richly rewarded..It would be perverse to give away its unlikeliest turns, but suffice to say that it is sometimes a pleasure to sit in a room with people who did not know what movie they had signed up to watch.The Neon Demon is a beautiful film, but it is so much more..While we all know modeling and high fashion are hard industries with lots of backstabbing and manipulation, Refns take is more surreal and unnerving. , Even in moments when were supposed to be scared or thrilled, particularly in the tacky third act, you laugh at the absurdity. , The Neon Demon offers, without a doubt, incomparable style and substance..THE NEON DEMON will be remembered as a great experiment gone somewhat askew. Rather than adopt cheap clich s and formula, Refn embraces complex themes to tell an astounding original story..... brilliant both visually and in its hilarious skewering of a problematic industry Ive never been able to understand or embrace. , The Neon Demon is a genuinely mesmerising combination of image and sound.

But the fragility of the American Dream was revealing itself as the illusion it had always truly been..The Godfather films have set home video standards for decades, and that trend continues with Paramounts astonishing 4K restorations..50 years after its release on March 24, 1972, The Godfather is now and forever, one of the greats..An engrossing metaphor for American capitalism, watching the film on the big screen emphasises the majesty of Coppolas work..It is a gangster film without any of the pity and hatred we might feel towards such aliens in our midst, because it recognises that in all of us there is the ignition towards power and criminality..The Godfather justifies every minute of its extravagant running time..For all its graphic violence, the movie was unlike the novel it was based on no mere exercise in popcorn sensationalism it was emotionally complex, tragic, melancholy, definitely for grownups..As the doomy burnish of Gordon Willis’s photography captures the darkened souls of the Corleones, the effect is flat out mesmeric..The Godfather is the most memorable, most influential, most quoted, most beloved, most discussed, most imitated, most revered and most entertaining American movie ever made..Five decades later, The Godfather still resonates with the paradigm shifts from one generation to the next, still influences one filmmaker after another, and continues to be the foundation of a lasting mythology..The Godfather is a rarity in film as every element off and on screen work here..There is simply not a character introduced or exchange of words or looks that doesnt inform or add. , Marlon Brando gives a bravura, dusty voice performance in the title role as the Sicilian who harvests favours from all comers, only to ask them to be paid back..The Godfather redefined concepts of Mob movies by standing out artistically, and that comes partly from its distinct look, as deep browns and blacks contrast with light and golden tints reminiscent of Caravaggio...violence and beauty indelibly combine..The Godfather shows that there is still life in the massive production engineering which made Hollywood studios the wonder of the entertainment world in their great days..The intimate camerawork, highlighted by closeups and staging actors as if in a void, creates a sinister edge to every scene."

The surprise is that its such an agreeable ride getting there. , Much like the films titular stripping protagonist, theres far more hidden behind the oiled chest of Soderberghs genuinely enjoyable U.S. comedy. , Even Channing Tatums admittedly glorious naked butt is powerless to prop up the limp, incapable Magic Mike, no matter how many times it shakes itself. , Worth seeing Yes. But also no. But mainly yes. So its a yes with some no caveats.

Once the cast have whipped off their trousers theres nothing very substantial underneath. , As if realizing too late that no real predicaments were established, the film creates a few all of which are hopelessly stereotypical, insignificant, and oddly unresolved..The dancing was about as bad as I expected it to be...although the movie is somewhat enjoyable, the characters are not great....Its all over the place, if mildly entertaining...I did like the way it was shot, I thought that was cool. , Its in its most dramatic side that the slight treatment of the ensemble by the director and screenwriter shows in a starker way its shortcomings and lack of virtues.

A boring boat chase and a slapstick final fate for our villain definitely takes it down a peg or two though... , If you want to see an out of place Bond effort that would have been vastly improved with Shaft or Superfly in the lead role instead of 007, give this a view..There are some splendid action sequences, notably a speedboat leap that set a new world record, as well as the usual array of hi tech gadgetry..As fastpaced and snappily entertaining a piece of claptrap as we have a right to expect..Tacky and cartoonish."

Deep in the heart of the English countryside lies the enchanting village of Gladbury. Legend has it every twenty-five years an angel visits the village candlemaker and touches a single candle. Whoever lights this candle and prays before it receives a miracle on Christmas Eve, but in 1890, at the dawn of the electric age, this centuries old legend may come to an end. When David Richmond, a progressive young minister, arrives in Gladbury, the villagers discover a new formula for miracles: good deeds and acts of kindness. While David's quest to modernize Gladbury sets him at odds with the old world candlemaker, he finds an unlikely ally in the lovely skeptic, Emily Barstow. Now, the fiery candlemaker must fight to preserve the legacy of the Christmas Candle, but when the blessed candle goes missing, the miraculous and human collide in the most astonishing Christmas the village of Gladbury has ever seen.",positive,1.0,"Magic and faith blend in story of good works and miracles..Essentially a daytime TV movie out of place in cinemas, but right at home on a wet Wednesday afternoon..A festive faith based film with two distinct target audiences Christians and fans of the hilariously hammy..Sweet film about Christmas miracles but a little slow at the start and neither Susan Boyle nor Samantha Barks has a big musical number..This holiday movie about a man of God who regains his faith thanks to a miraculous candle is as picturesque as a snow globe and just about as full of human life."

Go and see it, and tell me what it is that I just dont get. , Works as a solemn story about dealing with loss, tragedy, and disappointment, primarily because Gordon Levitts character bridges the gap between laughter and tears. , Joseph Gordon Levitt absolutely steals the show as a pranky, rude, anarchical antichrist figure....I love the film, the character of Hesher, and the fascinating and entertaining yarn told by writer director Spencer Susser. I feel that the script is a genius piece of writing..Surprising, entertaining, unconventional, irreverant, crass and at times very vulgar, Hesher is something, and someone, new and different that just explodes with life...and love..Gordon Levitt never puts in a bad performance, and he carries this film as easily as hes done any other. , Perhaps more interesting than outright entertaining, Hesher is something of an acquired taste..Powered by a character at once original and representational, Hesher courses with a unique verve missing in many independent productions, hovering somewhere between outright success and interesting failure. , Since Gordon Levitts one of the most energetic and inventive young actors in the business, you cant take your eyes off him. Unfortunately, the quality of the material makes you wish you could. , While it arrives decorated with cooler hair and a louder soundtrack, it still sticks to the Unusual Outsider Teaches Middle Class People What It Means to Really Live template..Headbangs straight into your heart..Gordon Levitt ... gets to play the opposite of his usual put upon nice guy roles and he runs with it, to the point of making Hesher downright scary a lot of the time. The rest of the cast keeps up with him, in their less flashy roles..Joseph Gordon Levitt must be especially glad for this film to see the light of day, because his performance is award worthy, a complete inhabiting of as unique a personality as youll encounter in film."

Joseph Gordon Levitt is back to drawing on his natural power as an actor. Hes skilled at creating absorbing human trainwrecks. , ... a promising concept gradually morphs into a predictable indie flick."

Full review in Spanish.Denis Villeneuves family drama goes to unexpected places that for better or for worse, stay with you for quite some time. Rewarding for those who stay the course. Full review in Spanish , Incendies is a gripping film, mostly because of the fearless performance of Belgian born, half Moroccan, half Spanish actress Lubna Azabal..Dominated by periods of eerie calm followed by sudden, astonishing mood swings, Incendies is intelligent, emotionally complex world cinema at its finest..Rewarding, but ridiculously stingy in handing out simple details relationships, geographical settings, etc. vital to our grasp of whats going on. , Watching Incendies is a long, hard, and emotionally draining experience but one that richly rewards the time and effort invested..Every time the film begins to feel more like a history lesson than a drama, it explodes into action..Its a raw and brutal look at the unending strife in the region, but its also an unforgettable mystery that keeps the audience riveted through one surprising plot turn after another. , ...an intense and shattering experience, a nearly great film about promises and kinship and the secret, cruel lives our parents lived before we knew them.A story of hope amid the ruins one that everybody can appreciate, no matter their politics..Enthralling and very disturbing..A beautifully filmed and movingly performed drama which explores how personal motives breed political radicalism, Incendies is occasionally but not fatally stymied by its clever clever narrative contrivance..Incendies acquires its heft from some very deep places Greek tragedy rather than newsflashes..Incendies is muscular, emotional film making of the highest order, self confident in its delivery yet always respectful of its characters plight. , Normally Im against decent original stories being dumbed down and squashed into bog standard thriller shapes. But Incendies is in dire need of some dumbing down. , Of the four 2010 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominees that Ive seen, Canadas Incendies ranks as the only one remotely worthy of the prize. , It isnt easy to open out a well respected stage play without losing a lot of its bite and subtlety."

Its a propaganda movie that shows no empathy for its characters or for its audience. , Padilha succumbs to monotonous, hollow flamboyance with his City of God clone..The moral dilemmas are gripping, but the film takes itself far too seriously to ever connect with us..A film that simply doesnt have enough cinematic flair to make it a better than average cops and robbers thriller. , Padilha gets as close to the daily violence as City of God, though this feels more like a documentary than an epic."

It lays out a promising premise but it never goes beyond the routine run of the mill horror flick that we have seen over and over..A tired procession of supernatural horror clich s..The doll from The Conjuring is as wooden as the scares in James Wans lacklustre horror , The actors may be milquetoasty, but the movies low key eerie atmosphere isnt. , The first half hour of Annabelle is interesting, until it makes sure to hit every horror film clich on the nose..The only way Annabelle can really affect you is if youve never seen a horror film before. , If you think making a feature length movie out of the backstory of a sinister doll might be stretching the concept a bit thin, you are correct..ANNABELLE never comes close to the near classic status THE CONJURING reached, but its a fun seasonal flick. , Annabelle is a dire effort from all involved thoughtless, wholly uninspired and utterly unnecessary..Nothing more than a case of a studio trying to cash in on the previous film. Its dull, predictable and really dumb. , Annabelle will likely make seasoned horror fans giggle occasionally, but it fulfills its basic genre duty for much of its running time, its scary. , What could have been a companion piece to The Conjuring is instead a yawn inducing show..The film has a good sprinkling of campy awareness, but never chooses the laugh over the scare..It will give you your moneys worth, while not really serving you anything too memorable or scary as some of the other, more sinister horror films weve seen in the last few years. , An outline of a horror film rather than the full embodiment, guided by general exercises instead of ambitiously choreographed routines..In the hands of a better creative team, an all Annabelle film might have been a grand slam. Here its a bloop single, narrowly avoiding a tag out on the basepaths. , Annabelle, at its heart, feels like it should be part of an anthology collection, clocking in at twenty or thirty minutes, instead of at feature length."

Full review in Spanish , Casa de Mi Padre is an amiable but eventually tiresome Spanish language goof of telenovelas and floridly melodramatic, moustache twirling westerns..Even if youre making a bad movie on purpose, its still a bad movie. , Fundamentally, it seems the big joke of Casa de Mi Padre is that it was produced at all, and as a weird Dadaist joke it is indeed satisfying. Its hard, however, to recommend a film that feels like a giant prank. , Unfortunately for Casa de Mi Padre theres a very fine line between smart stupid and slapdash stupid. , S ubtle humor that slips under your radar instead of bashing you over the head is what makes Casa one of the more adventurous comedies in recent years....Unfortunately for Casa de Mi Padre theres a very fine line between smart stupid and slapdash stupid. , After awhile Casa de mi Padre begins to play as a conceptual exercise rather than a legitimately funny movie in its own right..Pretty much one long sketch painfully stretched to feature length Casa de mi Padre would have been better served as a short film series on Ferrells Funny or Die website. , How many superstars would devote themselves to a project this quixotic Whether you get the joke that is Casa de Mi Padre or not, youve got to admire Ferrell.

Sheesh. , There are some startlingly powerful scenes as characters grapple with expectations and feelings for each other. But the film is annoying in its cheap attempts to get a laugh..The script is inane, and though Ferri has some funny moments, the acting is annoying or hopelessly bland..A half hour sitcom stretched into an unfathomable 90 minutes of played out ethnic caricatures that should land the entire cast a lifelong ban from Italian pride parades..Its awful. , The movies vision of Italian life isnt that far away from that of an Olive Garden commercial. , There are laughs in the movie, and a lot of good feeling, but it seems more interested in its Italian stereotypes than its gay insights, and it must be said there is absolutely no feeling that Angelo and Nino are really lovers."

One story line moves forward in time while the other tells the story backwards revealing more each time.",positive,1.0,"Directed by Christopher Nolan based on a short story by his brother, Jonathan Nolan, this is an intellectual exercise thats unlike anything youve seen lately. , A nifty puzzle worth assembling. The film that put Nolan on the map. A psychological film noir breakthrough. Full review in Spanish.Although the plot itself isnt terribly complex, the editing is so labyrinthine that multiple viewings are almost certainly necessary. , The brain teasing mystery put Christopher Nolan on the map as a filmmaking force....Pearce is positively astounding..Nolans winding timelines and practical stunts are marvels to behold, but they seldom compare to the slow push in on Leonards face, as brief but powerful bursts of memory envelop the screen. , Think of all the ways that a linear film structure stabilizes us the cause and effect chain of events. But Memento is about a character completely destabilized, so Nolan destabilizes us accordingly in a way maybe no other movie has..Memento takes us on a mental trip of recovery, revenge, and remembering..Memento would only be half as fun with only one gimmick or the other. Instead, the backward storytelling and the frozen man make for a wonderful pair, combining into something far more redemptive than it sounds..Memento isnt just a film with a twist ending its scatterbrained storytelling literally keeps you guessing with every scene. , Christopher Nolans cinematic breakthrough... , If the prospect of having to do some of the work yourself doesnt alarm you, then Nolans first American film is well worth catching, a thriller which is for once authentically Borgesian, to use an overworked qualifier. , I cant remember when a movie has seemed so clever, strangely affecting and slyly funny at the very same time. , Writer director Christopher Nolans second film is one of the most original and ultimately confounding mind games to reach the screen since The Usual Suspects. , The young British writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has every intention of putting us through the mill, doubles his fun by running the whole story backward..The astonishing payoff takes the film to another level entirely, unleashing a battery of existential questions that shed new light on everything that precedes it..Pearces central performance is as compelling as the films premise and Nolans execution of it. In Pearces hands, Leonard is a time bomb with a short fuse. , You have to pay close attention to Memento, the most original thriller to come along in years and one of the best..This terrific movie, about one mans quest for vengeance, does everything a thriller is supposed to do intrigue, involve and keep you guessing. , If nothing else, Memento is a savvy comment on the queasy uncertainties of the postmodern condition, in which history goes no further back than yesterdays news."
59968,Our Idiot Brother,"Everybody has the sibling who is always just a little bit behind the curve when it comes to getting his life together. For sisters Liz, Miranda and Natalie, that person is their perennially upbeat brother Ned, an erstwhile organic farmer whose willingness to rely on the honesty of mankind is a less-than-optimum strategy for a tidy, trouble-free existence. Ned may be utterly lacking in common sense, but he is their brother and so, after his girlfriend dumps him and boots him off the farm, his sisters once again come to his rescue. As Liz, Miranda and Natalie each take a turn at housing Ned, their brother's unfailing commitment to honesty creates more than a few messes in their comfortable routines.

Sam Rockwell is just fantastic given that he’s largely in the film on his own.

Slow, but there are so many details deserving attention, the chance to take them all in one only enhances the experience..Someday, Rockwell will get his Oscar due, I have no doubt. But I bet that when that day comes, lots of movie lovers will look back and say, But it should have happened for Moon. , A throwback to the golden era of 1970s sci fi, Moon is a long overdue and morally relevant antidote to the overblown bombast of todays science fiction..Start calculating the costs to Lunar Industries of its singular form of devaluing, and Moons central premise stops making sense. , Moon is an old fashioned sci fi movie in the best sense far more psychological drama than space opera, dispensing with overweening CGI and loud flashy action sequences while harking back to subtler, more ideas driven entries in the genre."

Des hommes et des dieux shows certain undeniable affinities to Rossellini....Of Gods and Men explores the spiritual anatomy of a community of Christians whose love is tested by imminent violence..Both the scenery and performances in Beauvois film are impressive, but its downfall is mistakenly believing that the power of God is more inspiring than the power of men. , Quietly compelling, if not as emotional as you might have hoped.Beauvois shows respect for all of the characters and cultures involved the monks, the community they served, even the enemies that the monks remembered in their prayers..Una pel cula dura, hermosa y conmovedora sobre un episodio tr gico que fue, ante todo, un acto de sacrificio y resistencia ante la violencia y el miedo. Desde ya, una de las fundamentales del a o..Of Gods and Men has a slow, introspective quality that gives the viewer plenty of time to mull over the monks quandary, but it also has a feeling of constant dread. , In a world in which faith and ignorance are often yoked together, Of Gods and Men lifts faith from just the throbbing heart to the thinking mind as well..Alternately harrowing and humbling, this is a story of ordinary men whose compassion is tested in the cruelest, most profound fashion..A deeply moving and profoundly beautiful film about a group of monks working in the mountains of Algeria who are faced with the most difficult personal and collective decisions when the country erupts in brutal civil war.Beauvois takes his time limning the daily rhythms of the monastery, lingering on its most lyrical and sensuous moments, so that when violence finally reaches its gates the effect is all the more chilling..Confirms without really challenging our readily held beliefs about the nobility of selflessness and sacrifice..... as powerful a film youll ever see about faith, commitment and the courage of ones convictions."

Most of the acting is bad, and none of the characters are interesting. Watching it is about as culturally rewarding as actually getting drunk, and less fun."

Its a well written screenplay and director Mateo Gil makes the most of it , Embodied effectively by a craggy Sam Shepard, it is not the physicality of Shepard that convinces us of his identity, but his character and the morals by which he lives.Offers a fascinating imaginary sequel to the story of Butch and Sundance..A Western in possession of a social conscience, but without lapsing into preaching or patronising, this is an unassuming film in some ways, but ultimately its self assured, elegiac and sometimes strikingly beautiful. , A leisurely, elegiac production that needed a sharper focus..A subtle film that balances drama with gunplay..While Shepard is a classically, charming and grizzled Western anti hero, his co star Eduardo Noriega, above, makes for a stiff sidekick..Blackthorn is a handsomely mounted film, with many an awesome vista and rolling plain, but compared to the quicksilver brilliance of its predecessors, it comes off as irredeemably minor..With westerns rarer than hens teeth, and decent westerns even rarer, this is certainly one that genre fans should seek out. , It feels as unique as the way the ageing Shepards eyes appear weirdly independent of the rest of him. Hes a bird of prey gazing through the holes in a crumbling wall. , Lonesome Dove with a dash of My Name is Nobody and a side of Ride the High Country, but Shepard, Noriega and the exotic Bolivian locations mark Blackthorn out as a notable entry..What really grabs the attention are cinematographer JA Ruiz Anchias staggeringly beautiful Bolivian vistas, the riotously colourful backdrop against which Blackthorn tries to outrun his pursuers. , Engaging and enjoyable, this is an impressively directed, beautifully shot Western with a thoughtful script and terrific performances from Sam Shepard and Eduardo Noriega."

Still, the music isn t half bad considering most of the songs contain lyrics like Everyone is special in their own way..The direction, by Footloose choreographer and Gilmore Girls director Kenny Ortega, has about as much depth as youd expect from a Disney Channel original movie, but the films energetic and lively. , Unless you have a kid under the age of seven, youll probably find High School Musical a little too cheesy for its own good. , It would be unfair not to salute the movies message about broadening ones horizons and not being limited by stereotypes or peer pressure. But when an admirable message is packaged in such treacle, it just makes the message seem treacly, too. , Mostly, High School Musical makes an appealing case for an idealized vision of high school, where individuality is celebrated and even the mean kids know everyones name. , What infuses this movie with much of its spunk are Zac Efrons and Vanessa Anne Hudgens lively performances both come across as friendly, well adjusted, and immensely likable. , Pop fluff intended for kids stuck between Dora the Explorer and Gossip Girl. Consider it a bonus that its tolerable, if not fun, for the rest of us as well. , Theres no denying the tween audience was hungering for this movie, without even knowing it.

It just could have been thought out more thoroughly. , Essentially a far better than average B movie, slick in presentation and able to keep up a steady pace..This landscape, although dressed in the trappings of genre, is a thinly veiled exaggeration of Americas current, divisive culture wars, with Mickle and Damici leaving little doubt as to where they themselves stand or what is at stake for humanity. , This is no gallows comedy, its a survival drama in the mode of The Walking Dead. It has more in common with The Road or George Romeros late Dead films than most vampire films... , Stake Land is intelligently rendered horror. Its a cut above more recent efforts, being an accomplished and thoughtful piece of work and an overall, enjoyable watch. , Stake Land has strong characters, a lucid script, plenty of action, and something more substantial to make it better than average..May be the best blunt force trauma, tear your throat out vicious vampire film since Near Dark..Like Romero, Mickle has a pragmatic attitude to genre convention even the corniest stereotypes can be turned to new purposes..Like the film version of Cormac McCarthys The Road, it has quasi religious overtones and one very good scene... , A super low budget yet visually evocative genre movie done with almost utter earnestness."

Time to Choose from the many other documentaries about climate change is that, after dutifully presenting many of the usual horrifying climate statistics, it lays out a series of possible solutions, already available, to the crisis..What elevates Time to Choose, other than its very strong editing by Beck, is the sense that not only are people doing something to change the trajectory of our planet s depleted resources but that you can make a difference too..A film that shapes and alters your perceptions..Ferguson portrays the climate struggle as a winnable war, but also a titanic one, pitting a small, greedy plutocracy against the rest of the worlds citizens. , A sobering polemic about global warming that balances familiar predictions of planetary doom with a survey of innovations in renewable energy technology that hold out some hope for the future..This is not a film that leaves you in hand wringing despair.

Its impossible not to warm to the penguins. , It set the bar high for future documentaries..plays like a high end Discovery Channel special, but its compelling and beautiful just the same, exuding a love for its subject matter thats infectious , ...a glorious documentary about the remarkable mating cycle of emperor penguins..Did I love it No. Did I like it Sure..This astonishing film, shot in the Antarctic, captures sights never seen before..Its a rather offensively human centered approach to what should be a mystifying and beautiful experience. , Birth, death, romance, danger All play a role in Jacquets homage to a remarkably endearing creature. , Though it seems like a somewhat wasted opportunity to shed some light on these creatures, you cant fault Mr. Jacquet for his efforts. , Director Jacquet has cleverly figured out a way to anthropomorphise his wondrous, web footed subjects, as they deal with hunger, rejection, loss, loneliness, and sensuality..Morgan Freemans slick voice over compounds a slightly plodding structure, but the dedication of the penguins and the cameramen assure your wonderment. , Director Luc Jacquet captures some remarkable nature shots, getting up close and documenting the entire frigid process, yet the film itself plays like little more than a PBS special..Its a missed opportunity to make a great documentary, but still decent family entertainment, with awe inspiring Antarctic scenery and some very cute stars."

Margin Call is very well told..Chandor has a real knack for capturing the airless, cutthroat dimension to the modern workplace..Though perhaps trying a little too hard at times to project a macro profundity on its banks imploding thesis, Margin Call gets most of its tactics just right..Positively devastating..Chandor is at times fortunate to have such a talented cast, all of whom provide strong performances..Margin Call ranks among the top dramas ever made about Wall Street..Margin Call effectively portrays these masters of the universe as flawed folk who were just as ill informed, unaware and ultimately scared of losing it all as the general public..The movie is about gamesmanship and ruthlessness and what it takes to find room at the top. And stay there..... digs into the how and why of the market crash, not just in terms of economics but in the culture of Wall Street and the justifications that individuals tell themselves in order to follow the company line."

But what begins like a prophetic Wall Street set John Grisham novel quickly becomes a stalemate of soliloquies..Margin Call is worth seeing for its cast and for its intentions, but its easy to imagine how the whole thing could have been done better. , Not only does it offer no new insights into an issue everyone needs to understand its also about as enthralling as watching an investment banker pace his office all day while alternately talking and yelling into the telephone glued onto his ear. , Vague on details regarding the company or the reasons for its impending demise, the film is far more meticulous in painting the possible final hours for this company that unfolds almost like a reverse werewolf tale..Margin Call is Wall Street for now. That a sexy Gordon Gekko type villain is no longer anywhere to be found shows just how much worse things really are today."

A brilliant film that shines in every department. Full review in Spanish.This Brazilian import is a dazzling achievement that marked Fernando Meirelles as a world class filmmaker his subsequent credit would be The Constant Gardener, the best film of 2005 ..Sometime I find it hard to judge performances in a foreign language but I have to say the performances in City of God are very strong, particularly that of Leandro Firmino as Little Ze..A powerful, darkly skewed coming of age film that peerlessly makes use of its obscure setting and striking authenticity..A masterpiece of modern filmmaking..What makes City of God so breathtaking is director Fernando Meirelles passion for these people he gives us the color, the music and the humor... , City Of God is the very definition of cinematic lightning in a bottle..Its point blank perspective on murder and growing up amidst the violence will leave U.S. moviegoers feeling a macabre sense of satisfaction, immediately followed by horror, as they witnesses the vicious cycle of violence repeats itself anew. , I came away from this film impressed by its narrative control but unmoved by anything it had to say..Powerful, but only for 17 and up..Each chapter is endowed with powerful, uncompromising, beguiling and, sometimes, deceptive momentum. What seem like innocuous turns become so critical to the narrative that they tie into the ruthless idea at hand You never see the bullet that kills you..Brazillian director Mereilles splashy feature debut, a dynamically exciting portrait of Rios violent gangs, immediately established himsef as an international talent to watch, and the Oscar nods only reaffirmed that status. , City of God delivers a bruising, visceral experience of the vicious spiral of violence that draws kids into a life of crime, brutality and murder as the only avenue open to them..Fernando Meirelles Brazilian slum epic is a profound, stylistically expansive depiction of three decades of child gang warfare on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro with non actors playing their poverty ridden lives for the camera. , The visceral and artistic excitement remains surface bound..Director Fernando Meirelles creates an aura of fear unlike any film in recent memory..Kinetic, exciting, brutal, its a supreme achievement and better than almost any film youre likely to see this year. , The performances, many from non pros, are terrific..City of God is not the easiest film to watch, but it is a masterpiece all the same, maybe the best crime drama since the Godfather films."

It is perfect for this film..The drug mule theme is somewhat of a distraction from Marstons more transcendent aim to push the story as a parable about one womans self determination. , The movie puts us in Marias shoes, taking us step by suspenseful step through her physical and spiritual ordeal. , A stunning performance by Catalina Sandino Moreno is the hallmark of the film....Unflinching drama of the journey of a drug mule..The subject could be, and has been, exploitative in other films, but Joshua Marston shrewdly sketches asides of drama about whether Maria should simply remain in New York. To his credit, that outcome feels as fraught with peril as her drug running..Maria Full Of Grace was a hit at the Sundance Film Festival and carries the cinematic currency of an important and thought provoking drama..Maria Full of Grace offers a clear picture of the economics that drive the hopeless many to take risks in the enrichment of the few. , Moreno gives a very memorable debut performance....The films star, Catalina Sandino Moreno, has heavy lidded eyes and a lovely, open face that belie Marias steely resolve. , the filmmakers eye and ear for authentic detail and believable characterization...make the film an unusually tough and gritty slice of underworld life. , Belongs to Moreno..Maria Full of Grace provides an authentic and compelling view of a drug mules experience. , Moreno uma daquelas atrizes que prendem o olhar do espectador, que, fascinado, mal percebe o sutil trabalho de construo de personagem que est sendo desenvolvido..Moreno communicates without words she immediately sells the film, the concept, the struggle, the danger..Catalina Sandino Moreno gives a superb, naturalistic performance as Maria and Marston is careful not to glamorise her, despite the fact that shes absurdly gorgeous. ,"

Its your typical indie drama. , Plummer, who won an Oscar for this, is that rare actor lucky enough to manage half a century of undiminished dash and elan on screen..Life begins at death. A funny, engaging romantic dramedy about never being too late to find happiness..Una historia profundamente humana en la que el director no teme escarbar en sus propios fantasmas.

But it’s certainly a good one..You could add Parker Posey, Christina Ricci, and Wes Anderson and still not get a communal circle quite this strange yet incredibly appealing..Personally, I find Damsels in Distress to be darkly and disturbingly hysterical..Damsels in Distress is genteel lowbrow farce, with musical comedy aspirations..Stillman manages to allow the audience to engage with them and identify with their existential crisis by revealing their humanity through a script riddled with wit and dense, revealing dialogue..Its completely absurd, and though overlong, completely hilarious. , It really is a delight a challenge in the form of a self deprecating joke..A rare, perplexing, rather joyous oddity..I ts daffy, otherworldly story, rehearsing but not rehashing Stillmans frankly reactionary instincts, resounds less for its charming gaggle of collegiate women than for its dramatization of self deception and the despair of depression. , Although the themes of clueless rich kids acting boorishly are very much the same as in Stillman s biggest hits, Metropolitan and Barcelona, the light and breezy Damsels more than stands on its own as an Austen tatious delight..One doesnt realize one has missed the airless irony of Whit Stillman until one sees Stillmans first feature film in 13 years. , Greta Gerwig gives a career defining performance..And while it occasionally feels a little wobbly, it grows more sure of itself and richer as it goes along..While the highly mannered banter on show here doesnt quite have the cutting ring of Whit Stillmans epocal, yuppie era conversation piece Metropolitan 1990 , it brims with dry wit and wry observations about college life and awkward emotions."

No, this is one of those rare films where its badness turns the cogs of your brain..A Haunted House is technically inept, monotonous, and stiflingly cheap looking. How this cost 2.5 million dollars to produce is beyond me..Too banal to be offensive, its certainly one to miss , Frustratingly, theres actually talent on screen that hints at what could have been a cleverly comical take on the found footage genre. , Heck, worse films starring Robert De Niro have been released this year..Yet another spoof from Wayans and Alvarez, this movie isnt nearly as bad as it could have been they also produced the resolutely unfunny Scary Movie 2 and Dance Flick . , Theres just an odd recurrence of homophobic humor in the entire movie that compensates for lack of actual humor. , This send up of the Paranormal Activity films provides a few laughs here and there, but for the most part its crude and clichd script is ridiculously stupid, embarrassingly over the top and occasionally offensive..This Haunted House needs a KEEP OUT sign nailed to the door..Just another in a long line of mercilessly unfunny spoofs..Clearly what the world needs right now is another low rent horror movie spoof. And this ones not bad. Sticking to Paranormal Activity for its premise, it actually produces some pretty funny moments. , A painfully unfunny, overly familiar send up of recent horror franchises..Sporadically misogynistic, homophobic and grade school puerile in equal measure, it is also not without the occasional laugh out loud moment..The moments where you feel the cast are off script and riffing are fun if not actually funny, but the most horrific thing on offer here is misogyny..Dreadful..This is the first film Ive seen that depicts rape perpetrated by a bisexual, weed smoking ghost, and probably the last. , Truly one of the worst horror spoofs of all time, and there have been some hideous failures over the years. Poorly written, repetitive and offensive on every level without being funny. Wait, Im just getting started. , I thought coming down with the flu would be the worst thing to happen to me this week.

It is, however, a moving story of a boy trying to become a man, in spite of himself. , The nice girl love interest who wakes him up after one drunken night isnt given much personality other than a cursory interest in anime. , Honest, smart and ugly in turns, its a coming of age story on a wonderfully realistic scale, unaffected and perfectly cast. , A beautiful rarity of a coming of age story..Just when you want the movie to take a daring leap, it steps back from the ledge and starts resembling too many others youve seen about addiction. , The Spectacular Now works because it insists on allowing these actors and characters to pull you in with their alarming emotional candor..Plenty of movies about teens are released every summer, but very few successfully capture what it is really like to be on the brink of adulthood.

Early thirty-something American Jesse Wallace is in a Paris bookstore, the last stop on a tour to promote his best selling book, This Time. Although he is vague to reporters about the source material for the book, it is about his chance encounter nine years earlier on June 15-16, 1994 with a Parisienne named Celine, and the memorable and romantic day and evening they spent together in Vienna. At the end of their encounter at the Vienna train station, which is also how the book ends, they, not providing contact information to the other, vowed to meet each other again in exactly six months at that very spot. As the media scrum at the bookstore nears its conclusion, Jesse spots Celine in the crowd, she who only found out about the book when she earlier saw his photograph promoting this public appearance. Much like their previous encounter, Jesse and Celine, who is now an environmental activist, decide to spend time together until he is supposed to catch his flight back to New York, this time only being about an hour.

Linklater not only tackles loose ends of the original with imaginative aplomb, but he also works hard to make the movie work as a standalone essay....Before Sunset is a great film, great for the ways it transforms and enlarges the conceit of the single night together to allow for years of elapsed time.....a superior sequel that accomplishes everything that one mightve hoped... , A stone cold masterpiece..Its a lovely, beguiling little film a rare treat during this overheated season of blockbusters. Its also an unusual example of a follow up that doesnt seem forced, but expands effortlessly on the original. , The reunion has some lively moments, but a great deal of slow walking and fatuous talking about love, married life and sex..Shooting in long takes, Linklater and his actors who get co screenwriting credit allow the conversation to curlicue effortlessly from literate banter to matters of the heart, and sometimes to places in between..Charming, talky romance for older teens and adults..As a romance streaked with regrets, obligations and fears, Sunset builds to a wistful, perfect conclusion a fadeout infused with the idea that a memory s never finished as long as you re alive and one of the loveliest last line exchanges of all time..the film takes a miraculous healing turn at the end, and the characters rise above their ruefulness, and use it as a springboard into hope.Well acted, very well written, well told, and bears yet another ending that will keep audiences wondering..Linklater, Hawke and Delpy have collaborated on the script, resulting in an enthralling snapshot of life from the point of view of two like souls who spark by just being in each others presence. , Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have reconvened to bring us this belated, yet very welcome sequel..I was charmed, engaged and moved by the delightful Before Sunset, and without having re seen the earlier picture, it has been upgraded in my mind in the light of the new one..Before Sunset retains most of what was engaging about the first movie it has its gentleness, its romanticism and, most importantly, its idealism. What it has lost is the sense of mystery..A gemlike minimalist triumph deeper and more provocative than its predecessor."

Early thirty-something American Jesse Wallace is in a Paris bookstore, the last stop on a tour to promote his best selling book, This Time. Although he is vague to reporters about the source material for the book, it is about his chance encounter nine years earlier on June 15-16, 1994 with a Parisienne named Celine, and the memorable and romantic day and evening they spent together in Vienna. At the end of their encounter at the Vienna train station, which is also how the book ends, they, not providing contact information to the other, vowed to meet each other again in exactly six months at that very spot. As the media scrum at the bookstore nears its conclusion, Jesse spots Celine in the crowd, she who only found out about the book when she earlier saw his photograph promoting this public appearance. Much like their previous encounter, Jesse and Celine, who is now an environmental activist, decide to spend time together until he is supposed to catch his flight back to New York, this time only being about an hour. Beyond the issue of the six month meeting, what has happened in their lives in the intervening nine years, and their current lives, they once again talk about their philosophies of life and love, this time with the knowledge of their day together and how it shaped what has happened to them.",negative,0.0,"One of the difficulties is that the film makes no distinction between the inevitable, natural processes of aging and change and the ways in which people are worn down by man made circumstances..This middle segment ends up being the least invigorating... Before Sunset feels a bit less substantial. Jesse and Celine play less easily off one another, their interactions clouded by adulthood, responsibility, etc."

Full review in Spanish.The prospect of journeying to Hell and back seems less daunting than sitting through another horror yarn made in the faux documentary style of The Blair Witch Project, but The Last Exorcism proves to be a pleasant surprise..It may seem churlish in this day and age to fault a film for being unoriginal and derivative, but unfortunately the many, many nods to The Exorcist overpowered the original, admirable elements of The Last Exorcism..It all makes for interesting, and even terrifying, viewing at times. But its not very smart and far too predictable. , A bad 12 minutes before the credits is all it takes to undo the goodwill generated by a generally sturdy 74 minutes preceding..The Last Exorcism is completely boring, devoid of any scares, tension or unease and has one of the worst endings ever. Avoid at all costs..Its disappointing if not exactly surprising when at the halfway point the film turns into The Linda Blair Witch Project. , A fairly absorbing pseudo documentary demonic possession flick with all the bodily contortions and jittery camerawork youd expect. , Even if you take The Last Exorcism on its own terms, you re going to be in for quite an uneventful movie..The seams are obvious in this faux documentary, but the thrills are fairly genuine."

The payoff may not be what most are hoping for, but it is still good enough to satisfy fans of the genre..I cannot emphasize enough how well acted and gripping this film is. It may be marketed as a horror film, but it has the pacing and emotional intensity of a thriller..The film is at its most chilling, though, when considering the possibility for cruelty that is created when powerful emotions grief, guilt are coupled with devout belief..Its mature focus on characterization really sets the film apart..If you make a film about exorcism, you better be ready to be compared to one of the best films ever made. Surprisingly, the film holds its own in that regard."

Theyre intended to be scary but having seen similar ones so many times before. , Insidious ultimately works because of Mr. Whannell s script, which manages to be inventive and unpredictable despite its paint by numbers formalism..A tale of intriguing situations that rise to the surface carefully and cautiously before they explode in a flashy series of stimulating resolutions..Finds a pitch perfect balance between homage and originality..Insidious is effectively creepy and is able to provide some great horror elements without the gore..The best horror movies get the audience talking back to the screen. Insidious manages that, and how....Insidious clearly borrows from several sources, but where it fails as a narrative, it succeeds as a shock a minute fright fest with plenty of atmosphere and dread..The ending struggles to explain too much and take itself a bit too literally, but mostly Insidious is an engaging treat."

Hatchet hacks its way to a return to the glory days of gore..Hatchets gore is so over the top and silly that, even though a womans head is literally torn from her body, you cant help but laugh when you see her tongue still bopping around. , In the spirit of the set em up, knock em down slasher genre, Hatchet plays fast and loose with tropes while adding its own bloody stylized spin and keeping things down and dirty..The film might not host an original concept, but its attention to detail the tiny things that made 80s slashers unique render Hatchet a far more enjoyable experience than its competition. , Lacking the satirical bite of the first Scream... this is mere pastiche that doesnt even wink at what it is pointlessly xeroxing from the past. , I enjoyed Hatchet quite a bit. I was never scared, and I cant say I laughed out loud much, but it has a very gleeful tone that invites the viewer in. , Only a brief, nicely sculpted bass clarinet line provides any redeeming quality..This may be the bucket of blood that splatter fans were eagerly anticipating ... but it is also an excellent horror film with solid scripting and strong performances that make it appealing to a wider audience..Enjoyably schlocky horror flick, with its tongue firmly in cheek, ensuring that there are several laughs to be had amidst all the gory, hatchet wielding mayhem."

At a running time of under 90 minutes, I was quickly able to go about my business of forgetting the forgettable..Nothing innovative, but a decent little effort in the urban exploration corner of horror, using some tragic history as a modern Gothic setup..The result, though no classic, is definitely enough to make you rethink going on a suspect European coach trip anytime soon..A cool concept is compromised when this film descends into predictable territory..After one effective scene involving a radiated Russian bear, the quality of first time director Bradley Parkers narrative starts melting down like a TEPCO facility. , Theres nothing but many empty scares and zero resolution... , Its strengths make it worth paying attention to, while its weaknesses prevent it from becoming the first class chiller it had the potential to be..Unsatisfactory both as a low budget schlocker and as a piece of entertainment..Theres nothing interesting, creative, innovative, exciting, suspenseful, or scary about it. We just sit there and wait for it to be over. , Chernobyl Diaries is a mismatched effort that was working with some intriguing core elements undermined by worn out recreations of familiar horror set ups..Sitting through this shaky cam disaster of Chernobyl like proportions is simply not worth your time, money or equilibrium..Dialogue is banal, the cameraworks predictable, and any subtexts missing in all the action. The flicks irradiated with a general insensitivity to human tragedy. The place, though, is deeply eerie on its own. , Theres a great idea hiding in there somewhere shame they didnt find it. , Youve seen this sort of thing before just not set in such an unusual locale. Chernobyl Diaries delivers on atmosphere at least, during the first. Thats not surprising considering that Oren Peli of Paranormal Activity fame is a producer. , For a film with radioactive bears running around, its often strangely dull, though the final descent into the concrete maw of the reactor itself is memorably hellish. , A rote run and scream wannabe scarefest that fails to deliver more than rudimentary chills..Someone should bury Chernobyl Diaries deep underground in a lead lined box so it cannot contaminate any more film goers."

Despite their relatively tender ages, they are both ravaged by the life they've eked out together and by the experiences they've had leading into their marriage. High-school dropout Dean comes from a broken home and never really had a mother figure; he never imagined getting married or having a family despite falling in love with Cindy at first sight. He has no professional ambition beyond his current work--which he enjoys since he feels he can down a beer at 8AM and it won't affect his work--although Cindy believes he has so much more potential in life. Cindy also comes from a dysfunctional family; her parents didn't set an example of a harmonious married or family life. One of her previous serious partners, Bobby Ontario, has had a profound effect on many aspects of her marriage to Dean. Dean and Cindy head off on an overnight getaway together without Frankie, seeking a clearer picture of whether their marriage can survive its many issues.",positive,1.0,"Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling give incredible performances in this realistic exploration of a love relationship, that back and forth between past and present.

You feel sorry for them but hope theyll get off at the next stop. , It is a tremendous testimony to Gosling that we feel deeply for Dean..It is a subtle, beautifully filmed, inventively structured portrait of a crumbling marriage and the lengths people will go to in order to save something that cant be saved. , Derek Cianfrance with screenwriters Cami Delavigne and Joey Curtis promises a wild ride with two of the most brilliant film artists of their generation..Blue Valentine is much more than just the movie that birthed the Feminist Ryan Gosling meme..Blue Valentine is a difficult, heartbreaking film, but its also essential viewing if only for offering a corrective to all of the tales of blissful, uncomplicated love weve been spoon fed. , Gosling and Williams are some of the finest young actors...and Blue Valentine is the perfect showcase for their skills..A vivid, heartbreaking and wonderful study of the birth and death of love..It is, at times, difficult to watch because it feels so real, but Cianfrance inserts just enough humor to make the material more palpable..Highly recommended, except if you choose it as your next date movie..Director co writer Derek Cianfrances insistence on framing the blue collar story through a hipster perspective emerges as the movies saddest aspect. , The film is non illuminating. It depresses you but doesnt change your life. , As adult relationship dramas go ... youve not seen something as rich, nuanced and true as Blue Valentine in a very long while. , See it for Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, but be advised if you take a date, youll be sorry. , Williamss beautiful performance is played nicely off Goslings remarkably vulnerable performance yielding a timeless portrayal of love, romance, agony and despair. , Though difficult and never exactly enjoyable, Cianfrances compelling and superbly acted film is still a rewarding and thought provoking experience. , The ghost of John Cassavetes looms large over Blue Valentine.

Blair Witch may represent the cutting edge of independent filmmaking, but its heart is as ancient and familiar as a Grimm s fairy tale.....a typically erratic found footage thriller that ultimately fares best in its opening and closing portions....here the endless trees, bare and featureless, become ever more disorienting and nothing quite captures the groups sheer desperation like the sight of a despondent Mike chewing on a fallen, dry leaf. , The Blair Witch Project is pretty tame in regards to what it chooses to show you or, more accurately, withhold from showing you but for its time, it was a significant achievement..Watching the movie gave me the same bewildered feeling I got when I finally watched A Clockwork Orange in college. This is what all the fuss was about , A testimony to the power of marketing a film..The most remarkable thing about Donahues work in this movie is that she is rarely seen on camera. She brings depth and emotional nuance to Heathers character through just her voicework and breathing. , Sanchez and Myrick are also smart enough not to undercut the potency of their tale by attempting to explain the unexplainable. They leave us with a mystery capable of haunting our dreams..One of its great strengths is that it breaks the teenage bloodbath formula. There is not a Jason or a Freddy to be found. Instead, Blair Witch is a thinking persons horror movie that exploits the imaginations power to terrify. , The scenario unfolds with so much real and raw emotion that it feels claustrophobic..A revelation in storytelling, cinematography, and marketing..There was a considerable number of people who went to go see The Blair Witch Project believing it was a documentary. Thats how uncommercialized found footage was as a conceit, and how elegantly crafted this movie is. , Directors Sanchez and Myrick understand the lure of legend and storytelling to the horror genre, and they cleverly choose to wrap the film up in various Russian Doll layers..Easily the scariest horror picture of the 90s, a movie that can take a place among the most potent and inexorable of modern shockers, like Night of the Living Dead or The Texas Chain Saw Massacre."

In the casual vestments of the Midwestern normie, she exudes that non actor naturalism essential to this American subgenre..While I hope the traditional romantic comedy will continue to return in evermore grand quality, this is a welcome diversion, and a lovely film all its own..Like a well crafted craft beer that celebrates the personal touch of a micro brewer, Drinking Buddies is one tasty treat..You are torn between pining for the attractive non couple to get together or you are rooting against the mess that could happen. Either way, youre hooked. , Drinking Buddies is that thing that they say doesnt get made much anymore a well executed, charming, effective, and plausible romantic comedy. , Its strengths are in what its not explicitly saying but quietly showing, something most films are unable to do. , A mature, earthy offering with a well rounded finish that will leave a sweet aftertaste.

The dark matter of life is abandoned for gimmicky silence. , Surprisingly wise..Drinking Buddies could suffer a little from its marketing, which may suggest to some audiences that it is just a regular rom com. But luckily, it is nothing like that. It is something much, much better..Im no beer aficionado, but I found Drinking Buddies to be like a cold, clear drink of artisanal beer savory with rich, emphasized notes while also sparkling with subtlety. , Every aspect of this film fits together nicely, even when the drama going on in the film is a little messy..This is a giant nothing. I cant think of a recent picture where Ive seen less effort to enlighten or entertain. , I was a bit skeptical when I first learned about Drinking Buddies, because I did not expect Wilde and her cohorts to be up for the task thankfully, I was proven wrong, and the actors go places that I would never expect studio seasoned actors to go..A beautifully observed dramedy about modern friendship and romance funny, poignant, unforgettable..It finds its groove with sincere, nuanced performances and a realistic attitude to romance as refreshing as a fistful of Citra hops..For a film all about the betrayal of those we love the most, Drinking Buddies is a supremely optimistic, warm hearted picture, with fine, freeing performances from its entire albeit very small cast."

Blue Ruin took me for that ride, and I was completely invested until the very end..Dark and devoid of excess plot, Blue Ruin tells a revenge tale filled with superbly tuned suspense and clean, efficient filmmaking..Creates a level of paranoia by telling this tale primarily in close ups and toying with focal depth..A visceral film about the nasty business of revenge..Unexpected events occur with intensity and force, blood is spilled but never glamorized, and the most unlikely of heroes transforms into a formidable opponent..Blue Ruin is not a truly organic story in terms of originality, but its brutal take on revenge and Macon Blairs mesmerising performance makes it one of the years best films that no one will have heard of. , For all its chilling realism, Blue Ruin collapses as it tries to fight against the inevitability of its genre and its inability to rise above that predestined path..Rather than give away its sparse elements, Id rather tell you its beautifully paced, and filled with foreboding Blue Ruin is a testament to the effectiveness of great acting and direction. , Blue Ruin is a great low budget thriller with an original voice and strong, realistic performances..Despite a plot hole in the otherwise well plotted and enticing thriller, its an ace calling card for its director and lead actor. , Saulnier has created a very brutal, raw image of the revenge thriller. He takes it out of the ridiculousness of Hollywood and how big budget films treat the sub genre..It is a straightforward, stark, no frills story, which Saulniers script tells with no extraneous sub plots or characters padding the narrative. , A well paced, well written, and surprisingly poignant film..Its a dark film, with a sicko sense of humor, thats not for all tastes.

But the acting is supremely naturalistic and, for such a small scale project, it does have an amazingly heightened effect. , The terror was raw and real all the more so because it was so understated..Though its slow in the beginning, the ending will leave you terrified and foaming at the mouth for a sequel. , A fresh coat of paint applied to an impressively old fashioned ghost story..For extended sections, this movie is very scary.

The six man comedy team responsible for the imported British TV series, Monty Pythons Flying Circus, now offers its first original movie, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and it is howlingly funny..A gut bustingly hilarious cult classic which remains just as funny and wonderfully ridiculous, the Monty Python crews comic exploration of the Dark Ages has lost none of its silly charm. , Some sketches are amusing, others are funny, and a rare few are altogether side splitting..Worth a look if youve never seen it, but real fans know the best is yet to come. , There are classic bits here about plagues, witches and chivalry, but their best scenes poke fun at ye olden days while stating that after 900 years, nothing has changed..The film goes on working a sense of humor that grows great in the continuous absurdity that always characterized the English work. Full Review in Spanish.The first non sketch Python film is one of the great Arthurian romps..Terribly exciting and clever, and while its sharpness has been considerably blunted through time, you can still tell where it once was..A fresh look at the ultimate mock epic, after the Python method has been assimilated into the cultural DNA, reveals the subversive spirit of this bloody and cynical Arthurian deconstruction..The material is superb, Neil Innes music is tremendous and Gilliams animations are timelessly brilliant. , So unnecessarily gorgeous, there are moments where it feels like Tarkovsky with drag and farting..Watching it, its hard to believe that these guys were actually meandering across heaths and trudging across rope bridges, with electricians and caterers not far away. It seems more as if this souvenir of the Absurd Ages has... existed for a millennium. , The Python teams surreal take on the legend of Camelot bursts with inspired lunacy. , This remains a wonderfully inventive comedy that brilliantly debunks the Dark Ages and legends of chivalry..Here is Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which is neither as sparkling as it is said to be nor as bad as it seems to be at the start. But its pretty good. , Monty Python and the Holy Grail may be 26 years old, but even in the fast moving world of pop culture, its no relic. Its still the Holy Grail of crazy comedy. , Theres a semblance of a plot, but this is really just an excuse for the boys to engage in their unique brand of humor, which includes mimicry, dress up, dry wit, slapstick and glorious non sequitors. , If you like this film, the sad truth is that it s yet another visual upgrade, and it does contain what Gilliam called the only reason for buying the Blu ray those lost animations..Grail is as funny as a movie can get, but it is also a tough minded picture as outraged about the human propensity for violence as it is outrageous in its attack on that propensity."

Full Review in Spanish.This is yet another found footage movie that lacks ingenuity and pretends to have a grasp on how teenagers behave..The predictability ultimately dilutes any tension, as the audience waits for the four kids to be picked off by whatever is in the building with them..If you like the found footage genre you will probably enjoy it but if you have had enough there is nothing here thats original enough for you to spend your time. , The problem is that all the scary scenes were shown in the trailers, there were too many unanswered questions, and they made Charlie almost a bit humorous..The Gallows is not scary nor entertaining and because of that whats the use of it , Sadly, the film has taken the path of least resistance, and has decided that it wants to be the annoying show off instead of the discreetly smart wallflower. It ends up as dead and soulless as its bland characters..The Gallows is a complete mess and only worth watching if you have an odd fascination of staring at floors while characters run away in a panic.Oh no, not another found footage movie, you think, and, unfortunately for the makers of the preposterously plotted The Gallows a formulaic, would be horror flick set in a high school that s exactly what I was thinking 80 minutes later..The ending is a let down, with all attempts at plot twists falling flat..I wouldnt want to definitively say The Gallows is the nadir of the found footage genre ... but I have to hope were nearing rock bottom. , Overall, there is nothing surprising or terrifying about The Gallows predictable, dull and painfully by the book..A generic, laughably incompetent found footage horror flick..."

Maths meets millennial doom in one of the decades true originals. , Its remarkable to what extent Aronofsky has rendered the cerebral kinetically intense.

The picture is more intriguing, though, when you consider its unusual casting..Dunham offers glancing and at times devastatingly funny hints at the world beyond our protagonists blinkered narcissism. , As Aura is unable to see past the immediate moment, the plot is structured in a way that provides no foreseeable linear direction to an inevitable destination..an interpersonal chamber piece that succeeds as well as it does thanks to the unabashed intimacy it has with its own diminutive subject matter. Call it a mumblecore mumblepiece..Endearingly frank..Lena Dunham demonstrates a keen eye for detail, a sharp ear for dialogue and a nice line in deadpan playing in this, her debut feature..Dunhams critics are circling but this is well written and funny. , Dunhams on screen mixture essentially all the Ss sadness, structurelessness, serendipity is stirred so skilfully it makes recent indie cinema of extemporisation, from mumblecore to Miranda Otto, seem like am dram. , A painfully authentic anti coming of ager..A superbly written character study with a terrific, vanity free performance from Lena Dunham that makes us warm to her character even as we recognise her more obnoxious traits..Tiny Furniture has been crafted in minute detail by a young filmmaker clearly bursting with ideas, quite the opposite of the films main protagonist."

The way our culture is going, this may be what a hip sitcom looks like in 15 years. , With no narrative per se and nothing holding it together except unity of time and place, it s surprising that Clerks plays as well, and consistently, as it does, with very little down time..Theres no denying the raw and energetic feel Smith created with a memorable script, great characters and a genuine sense of Gen X angst. , an exemplar of what can happen when the stars align and someones home movie can help foment a revolution , Clerks remains a defining debut, a symbolic shot into the darkened domain of legitimate moviemaking..Nothing, no matter how outrageous, is beyond Smith, and his willingness to flaunt cinematic taboos is one of the reasons why Clerks is such a unqualified success."

Much to Abe's surprise, Aaron does not want to tell Kara, it being a sole intellectual property of just the two of them, in the process moving the base of operation to a locked storage unit. Aaron's plan for the two of them is to use the invention to win big in the stock market by knowing through the time travel what has happened in the market. With two thoughts on the matter now instead of just one, Aaron and Abe may hit some logistical and philosophical roadblocks in how to move forward.",negative,0.0,"The storytelling is so confusing and the multiple timelines are so numerous that sorting out what exactly unfolds saps all the entertainment value..Wheres Doc Brown when you need him , Shot for a begged and borrowed 7,000, Primer looks it grainy ish, fuzzy on details and effects, acting running the gamut from A to B, and clipped incomprehensible technobabble for dialogue. , Ridiculous, confusing, vaguely noir ish nonsense..Shane Carruths ultra low budget, 78 minute sci fi film could almost be a B movie from the past if not for its icy intelligence."

But its nice to see the American migration narrative get out of the house for some fresh air. , A clear affection for its subject and setting help deepen Daniel Hsias otherwise shallow romantic comedy. , Its a sharp setup a rich American learns what its like to be steamrolled by unfettered capitalism but the script cushions things completely. , The camera work is beautiful, and the script is mostly crisp even though the spoken English without subtitles is sometimes as confusing as the Mandarin..Light mainstream feature has enough charisma and cultural observations but only just"
