Full review in Spanish. , The standard in modern blockbuster filmmaking. I don’t make the rules., A meaningful blockbuster that fails to play ignorant to craft or soul, it is no wonder that so many have fallen in love with the world of Pandora and the drama that takes place on it., W atching Avatar s 4K HDR format on IMAX 3D looks more incredible and visually stunning than the original 3D version in 2009., ...still a gorgeous sci fi epic, but the characters are nowhere near as detailed., Cameron and his artists have so lovingly imagined the moon of Pandora that every shot of the film contains new wonders., James Cameron’s been conjuring in his fevered imagination for as long as twenty years a true ripper. Of all the things that can and will be said about lt I gt Avatar lt I gt . is that it’s the one 2009 feature drawing from the War in Iraq that could make a mint., The same concepts are repeated over and over, and the sense of wonder gets lost progressively until it reaches a final struggle as spectacular as it is empty. Full review in Spanish , Functioning as both an action packed war movie and an allegory for our own beleaguered planet, Avatar smashes big set pieces together with big emotion to rousing effect., Five hundred million dollars wasted ., Absolutely astounding fantasy extravaganza. I was entirely immersed and immensely amazed. Avatar is a pure cinematic magic., With ground breaking cinematography and an amazing score delivered by James Horner to match, Avatar promises to set the ball rolling for the way films will look in the next decade., The level of detail and creativity surrounding the look of director James Camerons new world is simply astonishing. , Avatar is very nearly devoid of that spark of humanity that would allow the film to soar., ...as a member of the audience, I am happy enough to spend an afternoon communing with a society of blue creatures that look nothing like me., This is the evolution of entertainment. Full Review in Spanish , Avatar contains a metaphor against the invasion of foreign territories and civilizations, explained in two bad jokes about preventive war. Full Review in Spanish'"
