# AladdinRecommender

As the movie industry has bloomed and developed during the past century, an increasing amount of movies are delivered and published at a fast pace. The role of movie retrieval or recommendation tools is becoming not only more important but also necessary. Even though many movie information database websites(e.g. IMDB) and video streaming service platforms(e.g. Netflix) allow users to search for the desired films/TV series, they are mostly functioned based on predefined input format such as title, genre or regions that users have no flexibility to input arbitrary plots as searching queries. The goal of our project is to construct a content-based recommendation system that accepts informal queries like: “time travel and observe the history” and suggests top movies with the most similar plots. To understand the user inputs and its semantic meaning, natural language processing techniques such as transformers are applicable to this project.
